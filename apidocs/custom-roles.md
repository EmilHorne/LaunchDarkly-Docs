Custom roles allow you to create flexible policies providing fine-grained access control to everything in LaunchDarkly-- from feature flags to goals, environments and teams. With custom roles, it's possible to enforce access policies that meet your exact workflow needs. 

The custom roles API allows you to create, update and delete custom roles. You can also use the API to list all of your custom roles or get a custom role by ID.

For more information about custom roles and the syntax for custom role policies, see the product documentation for  [Custom roles](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/custom-roles).
