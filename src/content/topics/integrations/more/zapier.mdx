## Overview

This topic explains how to set up and use the LaunchDarkly Zapier integration. Zapier provides a platform for setting up automated workflows between different apps using a web interface. Each Zap has a trigger, and actions that proceed from that trigger.

The LaunchDarkly Zapier integration includes several triggers and actions for constructing useful Zaps. You can trigger a Zap on audit log events, with advanced filtering for finding the right events to trigger on. You can also toggle a flag, add a user to a flag, or evaluate a flag as an action in your Zap.

To use the integration, go to [zapier.com](https://zapier.com), create a Zap, and search for "LaunchDarkly" in the App Event search box.
