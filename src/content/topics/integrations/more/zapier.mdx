## Overview

Do you want to integrate LaunchDarkly with the business tools you use everyday, but don't want to write a whole application or craft the perfect API calls? Our [Zapier integration] might be just what you need! Zapier provides a platform for setting up automated workflows between different apps using a web interface. Each Zap has a trigger, and actions that proceed from that trigger.

The LaunchDarkly Zapier integration includes several triggers and actions for constructing useful Zaps. You can trigger a Zap on audit log events, with advanced filtering and globbing for finding the right events to trigger on. You can also toggle a flag, add a user to a flag, or evaluate a flag as an action in your Zap.

Using the integration is as easy as going to [zapier.com](https://zapier.com), creating a Zap, and searching "LaunchDarkly" in the App Event search box.
