## Overview

This topic explains how to use the LaunchDarkly AppDynamics integration to view LaunchDarkly events in AppDynamics. [AppDynamics](https://www.appdynamics.com/) is an [application performance management (APM)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_performance_management) tool. It allows customers to monitor the operational health of their application and infrastructure.

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>This integration is for AppDynamics APM SaaS customers</CalloutTitle> <CalloutDescription>
    This integration is not configured to work with AppDynamic's End User Monitoring products or on-premises deployments of AppDynamics.
  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

To configure the integration successfully, you will need to create an [API Client](https://docs.appdynamics.com/21.5/en/extend-appdynamics/appdynamics-apis/api-clients) with [Create Events permissions](https://docs.appdynamics.com/20.x/en/appdynamics-essentials/account-management/manage-users-and-groups/roles-and-permissions/application-permissions) correctly on your AppDynamics account.

## Configuring LaunchDarkly to work with AppDynamics

To configure LaunchDarkly to start sending events to AppDynamics:

1. Navigate to the Integrations page and expand the "AppDynamics" card.

2. Click **+ Integration**. The integration configuration sidebar appears.

![The AppDynamics section of the Integrations page.](../images/appdynamics-integration-panel.png)

3. Give the integration a human-readable **Name**.

4. Click **Connect to AppDynamics** to authenticate in. A popup window opens.

5. Enter your AppDynamics host URL. The format should resemble `https://example.saas.appdynamics.com`.

6. Enter your AppDynamics client ID. Your client ID is the name of your newly created API client combined with your account name in the format `<apiClientName>@<accountName>`.

7. Enter the Client Secret you received when you configured your [AppDynamics API client](https://docs.appdynamics.com/21.5/en/extend-appdynamics/appdynamics-apis/api-clients).

8. Once you have successfully authenticated, return to the integrations page and enter your AppDynamics account name in the appropriate field on the configuration panel.

9. Input your AppDynamics application ID or application name. The application name can be found on the "Applications" tab within AppDynamics.

10. Click 'Save AppDynamics Configuration' at the bottom of the configuration sidebar.

Your AppDynamics application now receives events from LaunchDarkly.

To further modify the events that AppDynamics receives from LaunchDarkly, add custom policies to determine which events the integration should export.

### Adding custom policies to the AppDynamics integration

LaunchDarkly sends all flag change events in the production environment to AppDynamics by default. To customize the events LaunchDarkly sends to AppDynamics, use the policy editor in the integration panel. To learn more about creating a policy, read [Example policies and templates](/home/members/example-policies).

## Accessing LaunchDarkly events in AppDynamics

To view events, navigate to the "Events" tab within your application dashboard. From there, modify the default event filter so that you can see "Custom" events. All LaunchDarkly events are sent with a "Custom Event Type" of "LaunchDarkly" and the following properties can be used to further filter events in AppDynamics:
