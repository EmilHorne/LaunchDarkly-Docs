## Overview

This topic explains the LaunchDarkly Datadog integrations available, including events, the dashboard widget, and triggers.

[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is a infrastructure & application monitoring service that offers [application performance management (APM)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_performance_management) and analytics.

## Events

The Datadog events integration lets you set up [Datadog Events](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/?lang=bash#events) to receive activity from LaunchDarkly. When something changes, such as a feature flag updates or a new account member is added, LaunchDarkly can send an event to Datadog. To learn how, read [Using the Datadog events integration](/integrations/datadog/events).

## Dashboard widget

The Datadog dashboard widget lets you pin feature flags to your Datadog dashboards to monitor and toggle flags from within Datadog. To learn how to set up the widget, read [Using the Datadog dashboard widget](/integrations/datadog/dashboard-widget).

## Triggers

LaunchDarkly supports using flag triggers with Datadog. You can use flag triggers to automate flag changes. For example, you can create an alert in Datadog that toggles a flag on or off if a performance metric drops below a certain threshold. To learn how, read [Using flag triggers with Datadog](/integrations/datadog/triggers).
