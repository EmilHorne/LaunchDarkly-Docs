## Overview

This topic explains the LaunchDarkly New Relic integrations available, including events and triggers.

[New Relic One](https://www.newrelic.com/) is an [application performance management (APM)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_performance_management) tool that allows customers to monitor the operational health of their application and infrastructure.

## Events

LaunchDarkly integrates with New Relic One. LaunchDarkly sends feature flag change events to New Relic as deployment events. To learn how to set up this integration, read [Using the New Relic events integration](/integrations/new-relic/events).

## Triggers

LaunchDarkly supports using flag triggers with New Relic One. For example, you can create an policy in New Relic One that uses a LaunchDarkly trigger to toggle a flag on or off if a performance metric drops below a certain threshold. To learn how, read [Using flag triggers with New Relic One](/integrations/new-relic/triggers).
