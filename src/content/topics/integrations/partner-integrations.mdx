## Overview

This topic explains how to build a LaunchDarkly integration as part of our partner program. You can join our Technology Partner Program to make your integrations publicly available.

## Onboarding with LaunchDarkly

Our Technology Partner Program empowers technology partners to build, launch, and go-to-market with LaunchDarkly. Benefits include partnership support, early product access, and joint marketing opportunities, among others. 

To get started, visit our [Partners page](https://launchdarkly.com/partners).

## Audience Reach

We list partner integrations in the following locations:

* [The Integrations page of the LaunchDarkly application](https://app.launchdarkly.com/default/integrations)
* [The LaunchDarkly website](https://launchdarkly.com/integrations)
* [Our Integrations documentation](/integrations) for configuration and implementation documentation

You can also list your integration on your own websites and platforms.

## Planning your integration

After you have completed the partner agreement, you can begin planning your integration. 

As you plan, you may want to consider the following questions:

- What value will your integration provide to your users?
- How will you measure your integration's success?
- What is your plan your ongoing support of the integration?
- How will you document the integration?

## Connecting your platform to LaunchDarkly

Next, decide how to connect your integration to LaunchDarkly. You can allow members to authenticate using an OAuth application or using API access tokens.

### Authenticating using an OAuth application

LaunchDarkly must verify OAuth applications before customers can use them. OAuth also lets you limit the connection of your integrated app to individual members. To learn how, read [OAuth applications](/home/connecting/oauth).

### Authenticating using API access tokens

We provide two types of API access tokens:

- [Personal access tokens](/home/account-security/api-access-tokens#personal-tokens)
- [Service tokens](/home/account-security/api-access-tokens#service-tokens)

If you use API access tokens for authentication, we recommend using built-in or custom roles to limit the amount of access to LaunchDarkly those tokens have. If you don't use custom roles to limit API token access, your members will be able to edit everything in your LaunchDarkly account, which can be a security risk.

<CalloutDescription>

As a best practice, we recommend giving your tokens the smallest scope required for your integration. For example, if your integration is not designed to modify your Production environment, use a custom role or inline policy to restrict access appropriately.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To learn how to use custom roles to limit access for an API tokens, read [Scoping personal API access tokens](/home/account-security/api-access-tokens#scoping-personal-api-access-tokens).

We also recommend storing your API access tokens securely.

## Choosing an integration option

If your integration is only interacting with LaunchDarkly resources, you may be able to build it entirely using the REST API. If you require a more complex integration, such as one with triggers or flag links, use the integration framework.

We require an integration framework update for any published integration. LaunchDarkly uses the `manifest.json` and associated image resources to surface your integration to users.

### Using the API

LaunchDarkly is built using an open REST API. Your integration can interact with LaunchDarkly in many of the same ways that you can through the user interface (UI). To learn how, read our [API documentation](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/).

### Using the integration framework

LaunchDarkly's integration framework lets you build deeper integrations between LaunchDarkly and a third-party service. 

A number of capabilities exist to provide integrations in both directions, such as sending partner-defined webhooks to third-party services or surfacing external feature flag-related links in the LaunchDarkly UI.

These capabilities are further outlined in the section below.

## Understanding integration capabilities

Your integration's capabilities are how it interacts with LaunchDarkly. 

LaunchDarkly supports the following integration capabilities:

- [Audit log events hook](#audit-log-events-hook)
- [Triggers](#triggers)
- [Flag links](#flag-links)
- [Reserved custom properties](#reserved-custom-properties)
- [Feature store](#feature-store)

## Audit log events hook

An audit log events hook is a webhook that LaunchDarkly sends whenever an event happens inside of LaunchDarkly. Each of these events is published to LaunchDarkly's audit log. To learn more about the feature, read [Using the audit log](/home/flags/audit-log-history#using-the-audit-log).

You can use this capability to send data to or trigger an event in another service. To learn more, read [Audit log events hook](https://github.com/launchdarkly/integration-framework/blob/main/docs/capabilities.md#audit-log-events-hook-auditlogeventshook).

## Triggers

<Callout intent="primary">

<CalloutDescription>

Flag triggers is available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Flag triggers let you turn flags on or off remotely from a third-party application. To learn more about the feature, read [Flag triggers](/home/feature-workflows/triggers).

You can also use the trigger capability to generate a unique webhook URL that your service can request to generate a user-defined flag change in LaunchDarkly. To learn more, read [Trigger](https://github.com/launchdarkly/integration-framework/blob/main/docs/capabilities.md#trigger-trigger).

## Flag links

Flag links let you associate feature flags with resources contained in external services, such as Slack messages and Jira issues. To learn more about the feature, read [Flag links](/home/flags/links).

You can use the flag link capability to apply custom formatting and metadata to flag links that originate from your integration service. To learn more, read [Flag link](https://github.com/launchdarkly/integration-framework-private/blob/main/docs/capabilities.md#flag-link-flaglink).

## Reserved custom properties

Custom properties let you store data in LaunchDarkly alongside a feature flag. To learn more, read [Custom properties](/home/connecting/custom-properties).

You can use the reserved custom properties capability to indicate flag-level associations with data on your service. If you don't have any flag-level associations or configurations, you don't need to use this capability. To learn more, read [Custom properties](https://github.com/launchdarkly/integration-framework/blob/main/docs/capabilities.md#reserved-custom-properties-reservedcustomproperties).

## Feature store

Feature stores allow LaunchDarkly to write feature flag data to a given provider. To learn more, read [Persistent data stores](/sdk/concepts/data-stores).

To view the schema for the feature store capability, read [Feature store](https://github.com/launchdarkly/integration-framework/blob/332ce1e6b58154f523a5bd7de8c7cd790c3bd4a4/schemas/capabilities/featureStore.json).
