## Overview

This topic explains how to use the audit log and history tabs to track changes made in LaunchDarkly.

## Using the audit log

<Callout intent="primary">
<CalloutTitle>The unlimited audit log is a Pro and Enterprise feature</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The unlimited audit log is available to customers on a Pro or Enterprise plan. For Starter plans, the audit log is restricted to the last 30 days of events. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

The **Audit log** is a running tally of changes made to feature flags in a given environment. You can access the audit log from the sidebar.

The audit log displays changes to feature flags for your current environment only. To view the changes for other environments, use the **Switch environment** menu at the top of your sidebar.

By default, the audit log displays the most recent ten entries. You can use the date picker to change the date range of entries the audit log displays.

Here is an image of the audit log:

Click the **Details** button for more information about each change. JSON patch changes include representations of the JSON patch operation, and a diff from the old and new JSON, if available.

Here is an image of the audit log details panel:

## Using the history tabs

The user interface (UI) also contains **History** tabs on the **Account settings**, **Feature flags**, and **Segments** pages, as well as on individual team and member pages. These contain a record of the changes made in LaunchDarkly to those resources.

<Callout intent="primary">
<CalloutTitle>The audit log for account changes is an Enterprise feature</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The audit log for account changes is available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

You can filter the **History** tabs by timestamps or search terms. Only some of the properties in an entity are searchable.

The following resources are searchable:
