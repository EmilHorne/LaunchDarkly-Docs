## Overview

This topic explains how to perform edits on groups of users with the "Bulk edit" option, or export all the users a flag is targeted to with the "Export as CSV" option.

The "Bulk edit" option lets you manage all of your user targets for a single feature flag variation. You can use it to make changes to users in large numbers, such as adding or removing them to a flag variation. The "Export as CSV" option lets you export all the user keys for a flag's targeting settings as a spreadsheet.

<CalloutTitle>Bulk user targeting limitations</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Very large lists of named users increase the size of the payload the SDK fetches when initializing, as well as the memory footprint of the SDK. Lists of over 50,000
individual users are not supported for flags or segments in LaunchDarkly.

We recommend not exceeding a few thousand individual users across your flags and segments. Instead, use custom attributes to target a large number of individual users. Custom attributes let you assign an attribute to the users who should receive the feature flag and then set up the targeting rules to serve the flag to users who have that attribute, so you can target groups of users without increasing the size of the payload.

To learn more about custom attributes, read [Targeting users based on custom attributes](/home/flags/targeting-rules#targeting-based-on-custom-attributes).

## Bulk editing users

If you have a long list of users you want to add, remove, or replace within a segment, you can bulk edit users from a flag's **Targeting** tab.

To edit users in bulk:

1. Navigate to the flag dashboard and choose the flag you wish to modify.
2. In the "Target individual users" section, click the **overflow menu**.

3. Select "Bulk edit." A "Bulk editing users" dialog appears.
4. Choose "Add", "Remove", or "Replace" from the menu.
5. Use the menu to do one of the following actions:
  - "Add" adds the selected users as targets to the variation
  - "Remove" removes the selected users from the target variation
  - "Replace" replaces all currently targeted users with the selected users
6. Enter a list of user keys or email addresses in the **these users** field, separated by a comma or new line. LaunchDarkly looks up users by key or email and displays them in the list on the right. If you want to target a user that has not yet been encountered by LaunchDarkly, you must enter their key.

You can update the list on the right before you perform the selected action. The options for updating the list include the following:

- **All** represents all of the users that may be impacted by the action, whether they are added or removed. Check the user's checkbox for the action to apply.
- **The checkmark** represents inputted user keys that currently match users in the system. For example, if you enter the user key `bob@example.com`, and `bob@example.com` already exists in LaunchDarkly, they will show up in this list.
- **The question mark** represents users with no matching records in LaunchDarkly. If you are adding users and the users do not currently exist in LaunchDarkly, they will be added to the targeting list.
- **The exclamation mark** represents user key inputs with multiple matching records. For example, if you enter the email address `bob@example.com`, but there are multiple user keys that have `bob@example.com` as an email address, the system may return multiple matching records. You can select the correct record by clicking the checkbox.
- **Current** lists all of the currently targeted users for the variation.

7. Click **Add N users**, **Remove N users**, or **Replace N users** to perform the selected action.

If you want to target the same large numbers of users in multiple flags, you can create a segment, set up targeting rules for the segment, and target the segment instead. To learn how, read [Building user segments](/home/users/segments).

## Exporting a list of users to CSV

You can download a list of all the users a flag variation is targeted to from the flag's **Targeting** tab.

To export a list of users to a CSV file:

1. Navigate to the flag's **Targeting** tab.
2. In the user targeting section, click the **overflow menu**.
3. Click "Export as CSV." A CSV file including the list of user keys a flag variation is targeted to downloads to your machine.

Here is an image of the user targeting section:
