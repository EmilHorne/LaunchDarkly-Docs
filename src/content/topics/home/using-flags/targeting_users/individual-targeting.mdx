## Overview

This topic explains how to use a flag's **Targeting** tab to control which individual users receive a variation of a feature flag.

## Assigning users to a variation

The "Target individual users" section of the **Targeting** tab allows you to assign individual users to a particular flag variation.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Only target small numbers of users individually</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

We recommend using individual user targeting for very small numbers of individual users. Individually targeting more than 10,000 users per environment may cause performance degradation, because the SDK takes longer to initialize when the targeting rules payload is large. To learn more about targeting many users, read [Creating targeting rules](/home/flags/targeting-rules#creating-targeting-rules).

</CalloutDescription>

If your application is already sending data back to LaunchDarkly, you can search for users by name, email address, or user key. These strings are case sensitive. Hover over the user row for more attributes for that user.

If you need to target a user that LaunchDarkly doesn't know about, you can enter their key manually. These users display in yellow until they encounter a feature flag.

In the screenshot below, specific users are receiving the first variation of a flag. That flag is targeted to them. This means that these users will receive that flag variation when they access the flag.

### Removing targeted users

You can remove a user from a flag's targeting list by clicking the user's name. To do this:

1. Navigate to the flag's **Targeting** tab.
2. In the "Target individual users" section, find the name of the user you wish to remove.
3. Click the **X** next to their name to remove them:

4. (Optional) If you need to undo the changes you just made, click the **undo arrow** icon to discard all changes:

![A feature flag's "discard all changes" button called out.](flag-targeting-discard-changes.png)
  
  A "Discard unsaved changes" dialog appears. Click **Discard changes** to undo all the changes you have made, or **Cancel** to return to the **Targeting** tab.

5. Click **Review and save**. 

## Scheduling removal dates for user targeting

<Callout intent="primary">
<CalloutTitle>Scheduling removal dates is a Pro and Enterprise feature</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Scheduling removal dates is available to customers on a Pro or Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

You can schedule a removal date and time for each individual user who is targeted by a flag. By doing this, you can specify a future date and time after which the user will no longer be targeted for the specific flag. You can do this when you add a new user, or for existing user targets.

This is useful if you want to give users trial access to a feature, run a controlled beta test, or just keep your flags organized by not having too many flags working at once.

You can also schedule a user to be removed from a segment, rather than from flag targeting. To learn more, read [Scheduling user removal from segments](/home/users/standard-segments#scheduling-user-removal-from-segments).

To schedule a removal date for a user target:
1. Navigate to the flag dashboard and select the flag for which you want to configure a removal date. The flag's **Targeting** tab appears.
2. In the "Target individual users" section, search for the new user you want to target or click the name of an existing user you want to set a removal date for.
3. Click **Add + schedule removal** next to the user's name.

4. In the "Remove user on" section, click **never** to expand a calendar view.
5. Set a date and time for the user to be removed from the flag:

6. Click **Apply**.
7. (Optional) If you need to undo the changes you just made, click the **undo arrow** icon to discard all changes.
8. Click **Review and save**.

The user targets are now scheduled for removal on the date and time you specified.
