Welcome to LaunchDarkly! We're excited to partner with you as you use feature flags to make high-impact changes with minimal risk and maximum control.

## Getting started with LaunchDarkly

To get started with LaunchDarkly, you must first create or join an account. To learn more about LaunchDarkly accounts, read [Joining an account](/home/getting-started/your-account).

### Using the dashboard

After you join an account, you have have access to the LaunchDarkly dashboard:

From the dashboard, you can navigate to LaunchDarkly's primary features in the left menu:

- [Feature flags](/home/flags): target flag variations to users and segments who use your product
- [Users](/home/users): people, services, machines, and other resources that encounter feature flags in your product
- [Segments](/home/users/segments): groups of users targeted by attribute
- [Experiments](/home/experimentation): experiments measure the impact of features you roll out to your app or infrastructure
- [Debugger](/home/flags/debugger): real-time insight into the events your app is sending to LaunchDarkly
- [Audit Log](/home/flags/audit-log-history): a running tally of changes made to feature flags
- [Integrations](/integrations): third-party integrations that let you configure the product to your specific needs
- Account Settings: [manage members](/home/members), [projects](/home/organize/projects), [roles](/home/members/built-in-roles), [authorization](/home/account-security), and more

## Setting up your SDK

In addition to Dashboard access, you must set up a LaunchDarkly SDK to integrate LaunchDarkly with your code. To learn more, read [Setting up an SDK](/home/getting-started/setting-up). For information about how to choose an SDK, read [Client-side and server-side SDKs](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side).

## Next steps

After you join a team, set up your SDK, and begin using feature flags, you may want to ask some questions to learn about your teamâ€™s implementation:

* Do we use both *temporary* and *permanent* flags in our code base?
* What naming conventions and styles are used for our different resources such as flags, segments, projects, and environments?
* How do we manage flag cleanup?
* Is there a standardized rollout strategy for new features?
* What LaunchDarkly role am I assigned and what does that mean?

To learn more about making these determinations, read [Best practices](/guides#best-practices).
