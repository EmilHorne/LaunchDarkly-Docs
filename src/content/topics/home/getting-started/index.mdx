Welcome to LaunchDarkly! We're excited to partner with you as you use feature flags to make high-impact changes with minimal risk and maximum control.

## Getting started with LaunchDarkly

To get started with LaunchDarkly, you must first create or join an account. To learn more about LaunchDarkly accounts, read [Joining an account](/home/getting-started/your-account).

### Using the dashboard

After you have joined a team, you will have have access to the LaunchDarkly dashboard. To learn how to create a feature flag, read [Your first feature flag](/home/getting-started/feature-flags).

Here are some additional resources for learning how to use the dashboard:

* [LaunchDarkly in less than 5 minutes](https://fast.wistia.net/embed/channel/mli3h9o3nh?wchannelid=mli3h9o3nh&wmediaid=j627spzhzn): A high-level video overview of LaunchDarkly.
* [Quickstart guide](https://app.launchdarkly.com/quickstart): The in-app LaunchDarkly quickstart.
* [Your first feature flag](/home/getting-started/feature-flags): Creating a feature flag tutorial.
* [Configuring an SDK and creating a flag](/guides/tutorials/sdk-flag): An in-depth guide to configuring an SDK and creating a feature flag.
* [Video overview](https://fast.wistia.net/embed/channel/mli3h9o3nh?wchannelid=mli3h9o3nh&wmediaid=c9x1gyt42d): A video about targeting users based on user metadata.
* [Flag rules and targeting](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/guides/tutorials/rules-and-targeting): A guide explaining how to target users with flag variations.
* [LaunchDarkly onboarding](https://launchdarkly.com/onboarding): A series of videos covering a variety of getting started topics.

## Setting up your SDK

In addition to Dashboard access, you must set up a LaunchDarkly SDK to integrate LaunchDarkly with your code. To learn more, read [Setting up an SDK](/home/getting-started/setting-up). For information about how to choose an SDK, read [Client-side and server-side SDKs](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side).

## Next steps

After you join a team, set up your SDK, and begin using feature flags, you may want to ask some questions to learn about your teamâ€™s implementation:

* Do we use both *temporary* and *permanent* flags in our code base?
* What naming conventions and styles are used for our different resources such as flags, segments, projects, and environments?
* How do we manage flag cleanup?
* Is there a standardized rollout strategy for new features?
* What LaunchDarkly role am I assigned and what does that mean?

To learn more about making these determinations, read [Best practices](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/guides#best-practices).
