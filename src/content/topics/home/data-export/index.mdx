## Overview

This topic explains how to use LaunchDarkly's Data Export feature to export and store flag, user, and Experimentation event data.

Data Export provides a real-time export of raw analytics data, including feature flag requests, analytics events, custom events, Experimentation events, and more. By exporting your data to a location of your choice, you can use your own data warehouse and tools to analyze event data.

## How it works

Data Export works by sending data to one of our supported **destinations**. A destination is an external service which can receive and store the data.

We support the following export destinations:

<ChildPageList path="/home/data-export" omit="/home/data-export/schema-reference" />

To learn more about event formatting, read [Schema reference](/home/data-export/schema-reference).

Some Data Export destinations have different event formatting schema. If you use mParticle or Segment as your event destination, we have specific documentation for their event schema.

* [mParticle schema reference](/home/data-export/mparticle-schema-reference)
* [Segment schema reference](/home/data-export/segment-schema-reference)

## Exporting event data for flags and environments

After you create a Data Export destination, you can send data to it for individual flags or for all the flags in an environment.

### Exporting flag event data

To export data from a specific flag to a destination:

1. Navigate to the flag dashboard.
2. Click the name of the flag you wish to export data from.
3. Click the **Settings** tab.
4. Select the **Send detailed event information for this flag** checkbox.
5. Click **Save changes**:

If you are using a flag in an experiment with allocation enabled, LaunchDarkly exports evaluation events for users included in the experiment, whether or not you check the **Send detailed event information for this flag** checkbox. If you do check the checkbox, then LaunchDarkly exports evaluation events for all users that encounter the flag.

You can tell if a user evaluation was part of an experiment from the optional `inExperiment` attribute. Evaluations that were part of an experiment have the `inExperiment` attribute on the evaluation reason set to `true`. To learn more, read [Evaluation reasons](/sdk/concepts/evaluation-reasons).

### Exporting environment event data

When you export event data from an environment, LaunchDarkly exports all data from every new flag you create after you enable Data Export. It does not send event data from flags created before you enabled Data Export.

To export data from an environment to a destination:

1. Navigate to the **Account settings** page.
2. Click the **Projects** tab.
3. Find the environment you wish to export data from.
4. From the **overflow menu**, choose "Edit environment." The "Edit environment" panel appears.
5. Select the **Send detailed event information for new flags** checkbox.
6. Click **Save environment**:

## Delivery guarantees

After your application has successfully sent an event to our servers, we will send the event to your configured destinations at least once.

An event is sent to your destinations exactly once, with some exceptions. In the event of a hardware failure or networking issue, we may send events multiple times.

Additionally, if your configured destination does not acknowledge receipt of the event, we will retry sending the message five times over a 30 minute period.
