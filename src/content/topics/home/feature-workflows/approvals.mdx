## Overview

This topic explains how to use LaunchDarkly's approvals feature to request review for changes you plan to make to a flag. It also explains how to review an approval request when you are asked to.

You can customize an environment's approval settings in the **Projects** tab of the **Account settings** page. To learn more, read [Configuring approvals by environment](/home/managing-flags/feature-workflows/environment-approvals).

Approvals let more people have input on planned changes to a flag. These review-style approvals mimic common code review workflows, such as PR reviews in GitHub.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Reviewing an approval request does not make or prevent flag changes</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Approving flag changes does not make them take effect automatically. An approval is a signal of mutual agreement on a planned flag change. A team member must enable the flag changes, or wait for a scheduled change to take effect, regardless of whether or not the change is approved. Similarly, declining a flag change does not prevent the change from taking effect.

## Understanding approvals

When a team member plans a flag change, they have the option to request approval for that change from anyone in their LaunchDarkly project.

Anyone with a `writer`, `owner / admin`, or custom role can approve a flag change, regardless of whether or not their review has been requested. Team members who the requester chooses receive an email notifying them that their review has been requested, and, if applicable, a notification in the LaunchDarkly Slack app.

Here is an image of the approvals email notification from LaunchDarkly:

![The email notification from LaunchDarkly.](../../images/approvals-email.png)

From that email, a requested approver can access a summary page of the flag changes and approve or decline the changes proposed.

To learn more about the Slack app, read [Slack](/integrations/slack).

## Requesting approval for a flag change

You can request approval on changes to a flag's targeting at any point after creation.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Your environment may require approvals</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If your environment requires approvals, **Request approval** is the default option. To learn more, read [Configuring approvals by environment](/home/feature-workflows/environment-approvals).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Here is an animation showing how to request approvals on an existing flag:

You can delete your own requests from the "Approval request" screen that is created after you request others' approval.

To learn more, read [Deleting an approval request](#deleting-a-change-request).

Here is an image of the "Approval request" screen:

![The "Approval request" screen.](../../images/approvals-approval-screen.png)

The only people you can request approval from are other members of your LaunchDarkly project. You can request approval from anyone in your project, with a maximum of 10 people.

Here's how:

1. Make the changes you wish to make to any flag.
2. Click the **dropdown icon** in the **Save Changes** button. The additional actions menu opens:

    ![The flag targeting screen with the additional actions menu expanded.](../../images/approvals-request-dropdown.png)

3. Click **Request approval**. The approval request screen appears. Users on an Enterprise plan also see the Schedule option:

    ![The request approval screen.](../../images/approvals-request.png)

4. Enter a **Description** to add context that helps your reviewers understand the changes you made.
5. (Optional) If necessary, you can edit your flag changes by clicking the **Edit** button.
6. Choose one or more reviewers from the **Reviewers** dropdown.
7. Click **Request approval**.

The people you chose from the dropdown each receive an email and, if applicable, a Slack notification, asking them to approve your flag changes. The flag's **Targeting** page also updates with an icon to indicate that there are pending changes waiting for review.

If your environment is configured to allow this, you can also approve or decline your own requests.

Here is an image of the "Pending changes" icon:

## Reviewing flag approval requests

If someone requests your approval on a flag change, you  receive an email. From that email, you can click through to the "Approval request" screen and review the request.

To approve or decline a change:

1. Find the email from "The Team at LaunchDarkly" in your email client. The email subject includes name of the project, environment, and flag you're being asked to review and the phrase "Review request":

![The email notification from LaunchDarkly.](../../images/approvals-email.png)

2. In the email body, click **Review request**. A new tab with LaunchDarkly's "Approval request" screen appears:

![The "Approval request" screen.](../../images/approvals-approval-screen.png)

3. Review the flag changes and choose to approve or decline the changes. Optionally, you can leave a comment summarizing your decision.
4. Click **Approve and Apply**. The "Review history" section updates to indicate that you approved the change request.
5. (Optional) You can approve the changes without applying them by clicking the dropdown arrow and choosing **Approve changes**. After you approve the changes, you can apply them by clicking the **Apply Changes** button that appears.

  a. If you choose to apply the flag changes, you will be asked to confirm your choice. Verify that you want to make the changes and click **Apply**.

  ![The confirmation screen.](../../images/approvals-applying-changes.png)

  b. If you approve an approval request but choose not to apply it, the original requester, or any team member with a writer, owner / admin, or custom role can apply the  changes you approved.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Anyone with access can leave a comment.</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Anyone with access to the approval request page can comment on an approval request.

The only time someone with access cannot comment on an approval request is after the request has been applied. Applying an approval request freezes the approval request page to preserve the state it was in when the change was applied.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

In addition to using the link in the email to access the "Approval request" screen, you can see pending flag changes and approval requests on the "Pending changes" screen.

To access this screen, click the icon on the flag's **Targeting** page:

![The "Pending changes" icon on the flag's Targeting tab.](../../images/workflows-pending-changes-callout.png)

## Deleting an approval request

You may delete a request for changes to a flag while it's pending review. You can do this in two ways:

* from the "Pending changes" screen, or
* from the approval request page.

### Deleting an approval request from the "Pending changes" screen

To delete approval requests from a flag's "Pending changes" screen:

1. Navigate to the flag's **Targeting** page and click the **Pending Changes** icon. The "Pending Changes" screen appears.
2. Find the change you wish to delete and click the three-dot **overflow menu**. Additional options appear.
3. Choose **Delete**. A confirmation screen appears.
4. Type the flag's name or key to confirm.
5. Click **Delete**. The request is deleted:

![A GIF showing the interactions of deleting a change from the "Pending Changes" screen.](../../images/approvals-delete-from-pending-changes.gif)
