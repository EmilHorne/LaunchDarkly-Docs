## Overview

This topic explains how to build, start, and view workflows in LaunchDarkly. A workflow is a set of actions that you can schedule in advance to make changes to a feature flag.

## Using workflows

Workflows can automate some of the manual tasks required to manage a feature flag. These tasks often take place in stages. For example, a feature flag workflow that gradually releases a flag to more users might look like this:

Workflows support consistent release practices and let you automatically release a feature based on your release process.

### Prerequisites

To use workflows, you should understand the following features:

* [Approvals](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/approvals)
* [Scheduled flag changes](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/scheduled-changes)

## Setting up a workflow

To build a workflow:

1. Navigate to the flag dashboard and select the flag you want to create a workflow for. The flag's Targeting tab appears.
2. Click on the **Workflows** tab.
3. Click **Create a workflow**.
4. Give your workflow a name, and optionally add a description.
5. (Optional) If you have an approvals process, click **Request approval**.
  * Click into the **Reviewers** dropdown and choose an approver.
  * Enter a description in the **Description** field.
  * You must add approval steps before you add schedule steps. If you accidentally add a schedule step first, delete the schedule step, and then add the approval step as the first step of that stage.
7. If you don't need to request approval, click **Schedule date and time**.
8. Choose a date and time from the date picker.
9. Click the **+** to add another step to your workflow.
10. Choose a flag change:
  * **Turn targeting ON or OFF**: Indicates whether the flag should use any targeting rules.
  * **Set default variation**: Changes the default variation when targeting is on.
  * **Set rollout**: Updates the percentage rollout on a targeting rule.
  * **Add segmenting rule**: Adds a segment of users to target.

11. Add another approval and/or schedule condition step to create another stage of the workflow.
12. After you have added all of your release steps to the workflow, click **Start workflow**.

LaunchDarkly now processes the workflow steps for you based on the timeline and actions that you defined.

## Viewing a workflow

To view the status of a workflow:

1. Navigate to the flags dashboard and select the flag with the workflow you want to view. The flag's Targeting tab appears.
2. View active workflows listed at the top of the targeting page.

3. Click a stage bubble for more information on what actions are being taken in that stage.

## Deleting a workflow

There may be cases where you need to delete a workflow. Deleting a workflow stops any further stages from executing. It does not undo any changes that the workflow has already made.

To delete a workflow:

1. Navigate to the Flags dashboard.
2. Click on the name of the flag you want to delete a workflow from. The flag's Targeting tab appears.
3. Click on the **Workflows** tab.
4. Click on the **overflow** menu next to the workflow you want to delete.
5. Select **Delete workflow**.

3. Enter the flag name or key to confirm the deletion.
