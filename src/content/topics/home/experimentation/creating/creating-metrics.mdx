## Overview

This topic explains how to create a metric to use within an experiment in LaunchDarkly.

Metrics are the measure against which you evaluate flag events. You can use metrics to track all kinds of things, from how often users access a URL to how long that URL takes to load a page. Create metrics that align with your business goals and connect them to your team's flags to track the impact of different flag variations over time.

## Understanding types of metrics

You can use two different types of metrics to track experiment results in LaunchDarkly. They are:

- **Conversion metrics** register events when a user takes an action based on a feature flag they encounter.
- **Numeric metrics** measure numeric values against a baseline you set.

These metrics can track different kinds of user events, such as viewing a page or clicking on a link.

The following table explains the kinds of events you can track with a metric:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>Event kind</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Metric type</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Description</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>SDK compatibility</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell><a href="#creating-click-metrics">Click</a></TableCell>
      <TableCell>Conversion</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        Tracks the clicks on a user interface (UI) element. For example, how frequently a user clicks the Save button.
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>JavaScript <br />React</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell><a href="#creating-pageview-metrics">Pageview</a></TableCell>
      <TableCell>Conversion</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        Tracks how many times a page is viewed. For example, how many times a blog post is viewed based on three different titles.
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>JavaScript <br />React</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell><a href="#creating-custom-conversion-metrics">Custom</a></TableCell>
      <TableCell>Conversion</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        Tracks events for any arbitrary event. For example, whether a user search called a service or not.
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>All</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell><a href="#creating-custom-numeric-metrics">Custom</a></TableCell>
      <TableCell>Numeric</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        Tracks increases or decreases in numeric value against a baseline you set. For example, how many items are in a user's cart when they check out of your online store.
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>All</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Some metrics require the JavaScript or React SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must be using the JavaScript or React SDK to use click and pageview metrics. If you do not use the JavaScript or React SDK and would like to track clicks or pageviews, use a custom conversion metric.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Creating click metrics

Click metrics track how often a user interacts with an element of your product's UI. Click metrics must be used with either the JavaScript or React SDK.

For example, you might want to track how often a user clicks a "Save" button when it is red versus how often a user clicks the "Save" button when it is blue. You can create a metric that monitors clicks on the button as designated by a CSS selector located at a specific URL.

You can even monitor clicks on the button across different URLs by telling the metric to track different URLs based on substrings or simple matches. For example, you could track an event on every URL with <code>/checkout-page/</code> in the URL path.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>What's a CSS selector?</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

CSS selectors designate specific areas of your product UI, like buttons or images, that your users can interact with.

For example, some CSS selectors include:

* `#example-element-id`,

* `.example-classname`,

* `button.example-button`, or `.example-button, .example-button-alt`.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To create a click metric:

1. Navigate to the **Experiments** dashboard.
2. Click the **Metrics** tab.
3. Click **Create metric**. The "Create a new metric" panel appears.
4. Enter a human-readable **Name** for the metric.
5. (Optional) Enter a **Description**.
6. (Optional) Type or choose from available **Tags**.
7. (Optional) Choose a **Maintainer**. By default, the person who creates the metric is set as the Maintainer.
8. Click the **Event kind** menu and select "Click."
9. Enter one or more CSS selectors in the **Click targets** field.
10. Specify the type of **Target URL** you want to track behavior on. There are four types of URL matching:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>URL matching schema</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Description</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Example</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Simple match</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        This sends an event when the user accesses a URL, or clicks on an element hosted at a URL, that matches the string you enter in the Target URL field or a formulation of that URL that included appended parameters. If you want events to record for URLs with substrings, specify each URL individually.
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>You specify: <code>example.com</code>.<br />  Views or clicks at <code>example.com</code>, and <br />
        <code>example.com#signin</code> send events.<br /> You specify: <code>example.com</code> and <br />
        <code>example.com/login</code>.<br /> Views or clicks on <code>example.com</code> and <code>example.com/login</code>{' '}
        send events.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Exact match</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        This sends an event when the user accesses a URL, or clicks on an element hosted at a URL, that exactly matches what you enter in the Target URL field. Identical base URLs with different substrings do not send events.
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        You specify: <code>example.com</code>.<br /> Only views or clicks at <code>example.com</code> send events.<br /> Views and clicks at <code> www.example.com/signup
        </code> and <br /><code>https://www.example.com</code> do not send events.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Substring match</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        This sends an event when the user accesses a URL, or clicks on an element hosted at a URL with a specific string of text in it.
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        You specify: <code>your-substring</code>
        <code>example.com/your-substring</code>, <code>home.com/username/your-substring/</code>, <code>
          launchdarkly.com/your-substring/settings
        </code> Because all of these URLs contain <code>your-substring</code>, clicks on the CSS selectors you specify on each page send events.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Regular expression</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        This sends an event based on a regex expression you specify. This lets you designate more precise locations to send click and pageview events.
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        You specify: <code>example\.com\\/account\\/.*\\/billing</code> This matches any string between <code>account/</code> and <code>/billing</code>, such as <code>http://example.com/account/12345/billing</code>
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

11. Enter the webpage URL.
11. (Optional) Click **Add additional URL** to track behavior on more than one URL.
12. Click **Save metric**.

## Creating pageview metrics

Pageview metrics track how often users see an element on a page hosted at a specific URL. Pageview metrics must be used with either the JavaScript or React SDK.

For example, you might want to track how often customers view an item when its price is discounted different amounts.

To create a pageview metric:

1. Follow steps 1-7 in [Creating click metrics](#creating-click-metrics) until you have configured the form up to the "Event information" section.
2. Click the **Event kind** menu and select "Page view":

![The "Event kind" menu.](metrics-event-kind.png)

3. Specify the type of **Target URL** you want to track behavior on. To learn about the different options for URL matching, read the table in [Creating click metrics](#creating-click-metrics).
4. (Optional) Click **Add additional URL** to track behavior on more than one URL.
5. Click **Save metric**.

## Creating custom conversion metrics

Custom conversion metrics require you to create an event name and insert it into your application to track conversions for any event in your code. To add a custom conversion metric in LaunchDarkly, you must identify it with a code snippet embedded in your app.

To add a custom event:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="java"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example event code snippet', value: 'java', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="java">

```java
client.track("Example event name", user, value);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The area of your code you should put custom conversion metric information into, and the type of information you should include, varies based on which SDKs you use.

Often, the information you should put in your code includes the event key, user object, data field, or numeric value fields. To learn more, read the [Sending custom events](/sdk/features/events) documentation for your SDKs.

To create a custom conversion metric:

1. Follow steps 1-7 in [Creating click metrics](#creating-click-metrics) until you have configured the form up to the "Event information" section.
2. Click the **Event kind** menu and select "Custom":

![The "Event kind" menu.](metrics-event-kind-custom.png)

3. Select the **Conversion** radio button.
4. Enter a human-readable **Event name**. This is the event name you will reference in your code snippet when you insert the metric information into your app.
5. Click **Save metric**:

![The "Event information" section of the "Create a new metric" panel with a conversion metric configured.](metrics-event-information.png)


## Creating custom numeric metrics

You can use numeric metrics to track the changes in a value against a baseline value. Unlike conversion metrics, which track whether or not an event occurred, numeric metrics let you measure changes in value against a baseline flag variation you choose.

For example, you can use numeric metrics to track:

- Page load time
- The efficacy of various search algorithms
- The number of items in a shopping cart at checkout

To add a custom numeric metric in LaunchDarkly, you must identify it with a code snippet embedded in your app. Numeric metrics must send a metric event value for each unique user in an experiment for accurate experiment results.

To add a custom event, put this snippet in your code:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="java"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example event code snippet', value: 'java', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="java">

```java
client.track("Example event name", user, null, numericValue);

/* The `user` parameter is omitted in client-side SDKs */
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Like conversion metrics, numeric metrics also require you to create an event name and insert it into your application's code to track metric data. The area of your code you should put custom conversion metric information into, and the type of information you should include, varies based on which SDKs you use.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Numeric metrics must send an event for each unique user</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

When you use numeric metrics, you must send a metric event value for each unique user in an experiment. If your unique user count and metric event value count are not the same, LaunchDarkly cannot accurately calculate the results for your experiment. When this happens, an alert appears on the Experimentation tab of the feature flags included in the experiment.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Usually, the information you should put in your code includes the event key, user object, data field, or numeric value fields. To learn more, read [Sending custom events](/sdk/features/events).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Can't access numeric metrics options?</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If the feature described below is not available in your "Create a new metric" panel, your SDKs may be out of date. To solve this problem, update your SDKs to the latest version, and [contact Support](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us) to enable numeric metrics.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To create a numeric metric:

1. Follow steps 1-7 in [Creating click metrics](#creating-click-metrics) until you have configured the metric up to the "Event information" section.
2. Click the **Event kind** menu and select "Custom."
3. Select the **Numeric** radio button.
4. Enter a human-readable **Event name**. This is the event name you will reference in your code snippet when you insert the metric information into your app.
5. Enter a **Unit of measure** to track.
6. Choose a **Success criteria** from the menu.
7. Click **Save metric**:

![The "Event information" section of the "Create a new metric" panel with a numeric metric configured.](metrics-event-information-numeric.png)


<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Choosing success criteria for numeric metrics</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

When you designate a success criteria, you can choose **Lower than baseline** or **Higher than baseline** depending on what you want to track. For example, if you're trying to track page load time to measure the impact of your infrastructure changes, you might want a success criteria that is lower than the baseline if your baseline flag variation shows the original page load time and you want to measure decreases in page load time.

## Connecting a metric to an experiment

After you create a metric, you can connect it to an experiment. To learn how, read [Building experiments](/home/experimentation/create#building-experiments).

## Deleting metrics

You should delete a metric only when you are sure you will no longer use it in any experiments.

To delete a metric:

1. Navigate to the **Experiments** dashboard.
2. Click the **Metrics** tab.
3. Click the title of the metric you want to delete. The "Edit metric" panel appears.
4. Click **Delete this metric**.

This metric is now deleted permanently across all environments in the project.
