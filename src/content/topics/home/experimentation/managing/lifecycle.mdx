## Overview

This topic explains how to start recording data in an experiment and stop the experiment when you're finished.

## Starting experiments

Experiments do not start collecting data automatically. When you want to begin a new experiment iteration you're ready to run, you must start recording it. 

To start a new experiment iteration:

1. Navigate to the **Experiments** dashboard.
2. Click on the name of the experiment you want to start an iteration for.
3. Click **Start recording**:

The **Start recording** button only starts a new iteration of the experiment in that specific environment. If you wish to run the same experiment in multiple environments, you must press the **Start recording** button on each experiment in each environment. This behavior prevents you from being billed for events you don't want to track.

To learn more about creating an experiment, read [Creating experiments](/home/experimentation/create).

After you start your experiment iteration, you can check on it at any time in the flag's **Experimentation** tab. Experiment data appears on the **Experimentation** tab after a few minutes. You may have to refresh the page to fetch new data for your experiment.

## Stopping experiments

If you have discovered a winning variation or need to make changes to your experiment, you can stop your experiment iteration.

To stop an experiment iteration:

1. Navigate to the **Experiments** dashboard.
2. Click on the name of the experiment you want to stop.
3. Click **Recording**.
3. Select "Stop recording this metric":

You can stop recording an experiment at any time. Just like starting an iteration, stopping an iteration only impacts the experiment in one environment. If you wish to stop collecting data from every instance of an experiment, you must stop each experiment in each environment individually.

When you stop recording an experiment, LaunchDarkly ends the iteration and stops collecting data about user behavior for that experiment. The data collected for that iteration is available in a table.

To view the data, choose the iteration from the **Iteration** menu:

Stopping an experiment is not the same as deleting an experiment. As a best practice, we recommend stopping experiments you're not using, rather than deleting them. This lets you retain the results and data the experiment has already collected.

## Creating new iterations

If you want to start a new iteration of an experiment, click the **Recording stopped** button and select "Start recording." The experiment begins collecting event data again in a new iteration, and its chart updates with new information.

Here is an image of the "Start recording" option:

Alternatively, you can start a new iteration of an experiment by choosing "Start new iteration" from the experiment's overflow menu:

## Managing experiment populations

Before you make any changes to an active experiment's population, you must stop your experiment. To learn how, read [Stopping experiments](#stopping-experiments).

To edit the population of an experiment:

1. Navigate to the **Targeting** tab of the feature flag in your experiment.
2. Find the targeting rule for your experiment:

![The user targeting section of a flag's "Targeting" tab with an active experiment.](experiment-targeting-edit-population.png)

3. Edit the rule's traffic allocation as needed.
4. (Optional) To disable traffic variation reassignment, click **Advanced**, then check the **Keep users assigned to initial variation** checkbox. We strongly recommend leaving this box **unchecked**. To learn more, read [Understanding variation reassignment](/home/experimentation/allocation#understanding-variation-reassignment).

When you're ready to begin the experiment again, start a new iteration of the experiment. To learn how, read [Creating new iterations](#creating-new-iterations).

## Deleting experiments

You can delete an experiment permanently from the flag's **Experimentation** tab by removing the metric from the flag.

<Callout intent="warning">
<CalloutTitle>You cannot restore deleted experiment data</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Deleting an experiment means deleting all the event data collected for every iteration of that experiment in every environment. We recommend stopping experiments whenever possible, rather than deleting them.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To delete an experiment:

1. Navigate to a flag's **Experimentation** tab and find the experiment you wish to delete.
2. Click the **overflow menu**.
3. Select "Remove metric from this experiment."

![The Experimentation edit menu with the "Remove metric from this experiment" option called out.](experiment-menu-remove-metric-callout.png)

The experiment is now deleted.
