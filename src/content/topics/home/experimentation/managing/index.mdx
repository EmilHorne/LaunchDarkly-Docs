## Overview

This section explains how to start and stop experiment iterations, interpret experiment results, and customize which parts of your user base are exposed to experiments.

After you start recording an experiment, it's time for the data to roll in. You can view everything your experiment is doing in the Experiments tab belonging to the flag contributing to the experiment, or on the **Experiments** dashboard.

Read through the topics in this section to learn about everything Experimentation can do for you.

Here is an image of active experiment data:
