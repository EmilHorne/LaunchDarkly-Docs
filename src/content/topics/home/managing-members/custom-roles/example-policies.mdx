## Overview

This topic shows some examples of different types of policies you can implement with policy filters for custom roles, integrations access, and Relay Proxy access.

It also provides templates you can copy and modify for your own custom roles, including reader, writer, and admin roles.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Creating private projects with custom roles</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Use the `viewProject` action to allow or deny members viewing access to one or more projects. To learn more, read [Creating private projects with custom roles](/home/organize/private-projects).

## Example: Granting access to specific environments and flags

This example policy uses the `*` wildcard to allow members of the QA team to administer environments that have tags beginning with `qa_`, such as `qa_test`, `qa_production`, and so on. This policy also allows members to manage flags in environments that have tags beginning with `qa_`.

To manage flags in environments tagged `qa_*`, you must specify the flag-level resource you want to control. Limiting `resources` to `"proj/*:env/*;qa_*"` lets you manage the environment itself. 

When you recreate this custom role, keep the **By default, members can view all LaunchDarkly content** box checked.

Copy this role and make any modifications to it to suit your needs:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'QA team policy', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
[
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["*"],
    "resources": ["proj/*:env/*;qa_*"]
  },
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["*"],
    "resources": ["proj/*:env/*;qa_*:/flag/*"]
  }
]
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Details summary="Expand Example: tag-specific permissions">

## Example: tag-specific permissions

One way to organize access to resources is by tagging individual resources, and then creating custom roles with access based on those tags. For example, you can create a `dev` tag for your environments and use it in a policy to allow access only to development environments. You can add tags to projects, environments, segments, flags, and metrics.

When you recreate this custom role, keep the **By default, members can view all LaunchDarkly content** box checked.

Copy this role and make any modifications to it to suit your needs:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Dev-tagged resources', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
[
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["*"],
    "resources": ["proj/*:env/*:flag/*;dev"]
  },
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["*"],
    "resources": ["proj/*:env/*;dev"]
  },
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["*"],
    "resources": ["proj/*;dev"]
  }
]
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Anyone with this custom role can edit resources that have a `dev` tag.

<Details summary="Expand Example: Granting access to flag toggles, but not flag rollout or targeting rules">

## Example: Granting access to flag toggles, but not flag rollout or targeting rules

This example policy allows members of the Ops team to toggle on or off any flags in the production environment. They may not change percentage rollouts or targeting rules, or manage any environments or projects. 

When you recreate this custom role, keep the **By default, members can view all LaunchDarkly content** box checked.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Do not use display names for projects and environments in policies</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Policies require you to use project and environment keys, not names. If you use their names, the policies will not affect anything.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Copy this role and make any modifications to it to suit your needs:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Ops team', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
[
  {
    "effect": "allow",

  }
]
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

</Details>

<Details summary="Expand Example: Granting all actions to just one flag">

## Example: Granting all actions to just one flag

The policy below allows all actions to be done to a single specified flag, `flag-1`. When you recreate this custom role, keep the **By default, members can view all LaunchDarkly content** box checked.

For a complete list of flag actions, read the [Feature flag actions list](/home/members/role-actions#feature-flags-actions).

Copy this role and make any modifications to it to suit your needs:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'One flag', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
[
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["*"],
    "resources": ["proj/*:env/*:flag/flag-1"]
  }
]
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

</Details>

<Details summary="Expand Example: Granting all actions to just one flag while showing only one project">

## Example: Granting all actions to just one flag while showing only one project

The policy below restricts access to a project a flag is in, while still allowing you to perform actions on that flag. In this example, the flag is called `flag-1`. 

When you recreate this custom role, keep the **By default, members can view all LaunchDarkly content** box checked.

Copy this role and make any modifications to it to suit your needs:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'One flag', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
[
  {
    "effect": "deny",
    "actions": ["viewProject"],
    "notResources": ["proj/project-1"]
  },
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["*"],
    "resources": ["proj/*:env/*:flag/flag-1"]
  }
]
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

In the example above, we use `notResources` to allow role recipients to view and modify `project-1` exclusively. We do this by specifying which projects the user cannot view, with one exception.

This lets you restrict access to only one project without having to explicitly deny access to every project except that one.

</Details>

<Details summary="Expand Example: Restricting actions within production environments">

## Example: Restricting actions within production environments

This policy allows using only these actions in the `production-1` environment:

- `updateFlagVariations`
- `updateTags`

This means they can take all other actions in any other non-production environment. When you recreate this custom role, keep the **By default, members can view all LaunchDarkly content** box checked.

Copy this role and make any modifications to it to suit your needs:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Non-prod environments', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
[
  {
    "effect": "deny",
    "actions": ["viewProject"],
    "notResources": ["proj/project-1"]
  },
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["*"],
    "resources": ["proj/project-1:env/*:flag/*"]
  },
  {
    "effect": "deny",
    "notActions": [
      "updateFlagVariations",
      "updateTags"
      ],
    "resources": ["proj/project-1:env/production-1:flag/*"]
  }
]
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The second statement in the code snippet above allows all actions in all environments and to all flags in the project named `project-1`. You must specifically allow access, or the roles default to the reader role.

</Details>

<Details summary="Expand Example: Allowing access to flags, metrics, and segments in one project">

## Example: Allowing access to flags, metrics, and segments in one project

In this example, we deny all actions to all projects, but allow specific flag actions in one project, all segment actions in all projects, and all metric actions in all projects. When you restrict all actions this comprehensively, you must add each action for flags, segments, and metrics explicitly. 

When you recreate this custom role, keep the **By default, members can view all LaunchDarkly content** box checked.

Copy this role and make any modifications to it to suit your needs:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Flags, metrics, and segments', value: 'json', },

<Details summary="Expand Template: Built-in writer role replication">

## Template: Built-in writer role replication

Because permissions are set to `deny` by default, you must explicitly allow actions for the writer role. The code snippet below is a replication of LaunchDarkly's built-in writer role. You can copy it and make adjustments as needed.

If you compare the code snippet below to the [reader role replication](#template-built-in-reader-role-replication), you'll find that every resource level is addressed except for `member/*`, `member/*:token/*`, `role/*`, and `acct`. By default, those resources are already set to `deny`, so you don't have to specifically `deny` them again.

Copy this writer role and make any modifications to it to suit your needs:
