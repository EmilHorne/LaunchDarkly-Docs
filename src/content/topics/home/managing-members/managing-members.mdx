## Overview

This topic introduces the concept of account members in LaunchDarkly and shows you how to use the Members dashboard.

LaunchDarkly supports user object management with OAuth, SAML, and SCIM. To learn more, read [Enabling single sign-on](/home/account-security/sso).

## Understanding members in LaunchDarkly

Account members are people who work at your organization or have access rights to your organization's LaunchDarkly environment for another reason, such as contractors or part-time employees.

<CalloutTitle>LaunchDarkly account members are not LaunchDarkly users</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

LaunchDarkly users are resources, including people, who encounter feature flags in your app. In many cases, they are customers or people accessing your product. To learn more about users, read [The Users dashboard](/home/users/users-dashboard).

Use the Members tab within the Account settings page to invite new account members to LaunchDarkly, remove old account members, or manage access controls for account members by setting roles.

You can search for a specific member using the search bar. You can also filter members by team, role, or the last time a member took an action in your LaunchDarkly account using the filters at the top of the Members list:

To learn more about teams in LaunchDarkly, read [Teams](/home/teams). To learn more about roles, read [Understanding member roles](#understanding-member-roles).

## Adding members to LaunchDarkly

<CalloutTitle>This is an Admin-only feature</CalloutTitle>

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To add new members:

1. Navigate to the the [Account Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings) page.
2. Click into the [Members](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/members) tab.
3. Click **Invite members**:

![The Members tab with "Invite members" called out.](/images/settings-members-invite-callout.png)

4. Enter one or more email addresses. If you are inviting multiple members, separate email addresses with a comma or new line.
5. Choose an initial built-in role or custom role from the **Initial role** dropdown.
5. Click **Invite members**.

New members now receive an email inviting them to your LaunchDarkly account. You can resend the invitation or manage a member's roles and team membership by clicking on the **Manage** button next to a member's name in the Members list. 

## Understanding member roles

You can assign different roles to LaunchDarkly account members. There are three different built-in roles in LaunchDarkly: reader, writer, and admin. To learn more about these roles, read [LaunchDarkly's built-in roles](/home/members/built-in-roles).

In addition to a built-in role, you can give account members custom roles to more tightly define the actions they can and can't take in your LaunchDarkly account. To learn more, read [Custom roles](/home/members/custom-roles).

## Enabling multi-factor authentication

For additional security, you can require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your account. When MFA is enabled, account members won't be able to log in to LaunchDarkly without verifying their identity with a second method.

We strongly recommend that all LaunchDarkly members enable MFA for their individual accounts, and that administrators enforce MFA for their entire organization. In the event of a credential leak or device theft, MFA can prevent malicious third parties from accessing a LaunchDarkly account they should not be able to access.

To learn more, read [Multi-factor authentication](/home/account-security/mfa).

## Inviting members with trial accounts

When you invite a member to LaunchDarkly, you may get an error message that says the email address is already in use. This can happen when a person already has a trial account with LaunchDarkly associated with that email address.

To fix this, ask the person to change the email address associated with their trial account or delete their trial account, following the instructions under [Adding members who signed up for a trial](/home/getting-started/your-account#adding-members-who-signed-up-for-a-trial). After they change the email address or delete their trial account, add them to your LaunchDarkly organization again.

You can also tell people in your organization to delete their trials before you roll out LaunchDarkly organization-wide.

## Using aliased email addresses in LaunchDarkly

Alternatively, if the member has a GSuite or Outlook 365 account, you can invite them to LaunchDarkly using an alias. An alias account is the email address of the person you wish to invite with a plus sign (`+`) and additional text string appended. `joe+launchdarkly@example.com` is an alias of `joe@example.com`.

For example, if the user object `alice@diner.com` already exists in LaunchDarkly, you can also invite `alice+newproject@diner.com` to your LaunchDarkly organization. Emails from both addresses are sent to `alice@diner.com`, but only `alice+newproject@diner.com` has access to your LaunchDarkly organization. This is also helpful when you need contractors to collaborate with you on projects.

## Removing members from LaunchDarkly

To remove a member from your account:

1. Navigate to the the [Account Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings) page.
2. Click into the [Members](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/members) tab.
3. Find the member in the list of account members.
4. Click **Manage**.
5. Click **Delete member**.
