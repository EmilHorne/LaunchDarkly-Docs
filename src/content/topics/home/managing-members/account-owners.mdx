## Overview

This topic explains how to change which account member has the Owner role in your LaunchDarkly account, as well as what the Owner role entails.

## Understanding the owner role

In LaunchDarkly, Owner is a unique role that only one account member can have. Owners have absolute power over your entire LaunchDarkly account, including the ability to add or remove the Admin role from other account members, or to remove the Owner role from themselves and assign it to someone else.

Every LaunchDarkly account must have one member with the Owner role. By default, the person who creates your LaunchDarkly account is given the Owner role.

To learn more about member roles, read [Managing your account members](/home/members/managing).

## Changing account owners

You can change account owners from the **Account settings** screen.

Only the current account owner can change which member has the Owner role, and only account members with verified LaunchDarkly accounts can become account owners.

If you are not the owner of your LaunchDarkly account and need to change which member has the Owner role, contact [LaunchDarkly Support](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us).

9. Scroll to the "Change owner" section and select the same new account member as in step 5. A confirmation dialog appears.
