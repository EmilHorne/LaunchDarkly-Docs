## Overview

This topic explains what the **Users** list is, how it is populated, and how to use it.

The **Users** list gives you a summary view of how each user experiences all of the features in your app, and lets you customize their experience from one screen. You can even set expiration dates for flag targeting, or remove flags targeted to individual users.

## Understanding the Users list

The **Users** list populates automatically when users encounter a feature flag and are evaluated by a LaunchDarkly SDK. The data in the list is populated from the user data you send in variation calls, as well as data from identify calls. To learn more about users and user attributes, read [Understanding user attributes](/home/users/attributes#understanding-user-attributes).

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>You cannot add users manually</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You cannot create users in the <strong>Users</strong> list. The list is not a database, and exists to serve users that have already been evaluated by a LaunchDarkly SDK. Evaluation always happens with the SDK locally on the machine.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

If a user's properties change within five minutes of their previous evaluation, and the user key stays the same, the list deduplicates the user and does not reflect the latest evaluation. This does not affect variation calls, which always use the attribute values passed to them.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>The SDK does not use the attributes on the <strong>Users</strong> list to evaluate flags</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The SDK only evaluates flags based on the user object you provide in the evaluation call. The SDK does not use the attributes shown on the **Users** list, and user attributes are not synchronized across SDK instances. You must provide all applicable user attributes for each evaluation for your targeting rules to apply correctly. To learn more, read [Evaluating flags](/sdk/features/evaluating).

</CalloutDescription>

From the list, you can filter users by standard or custom attributes. You can also sort the list to identify the oldest or most recent users in your LaunchDarkly account. By default, the most recently active users appear first. Click the toggle arrow on the "Last seen" column to sort the list by least recently active users.

To learn more about how the **Users** list is populated, and how you might exceed the 100,000,000 user limit, read [Anonymous users](/home/users/anonymous-users).

### Filtering users

You can filter users on the **Users** list by standard or custom attributes.

To filter users:

1. Click **Filter**.
2. Choose a standard or custom attribute to filter users by:

![The "Filter" menu with a custom attribute chosen.](users-filter.png)

3. Choose an attribute value from the menu.
4. Click **Add**.

Only users with matching attribute values now display on the **Users** list.

You can also use the REST API: [Find user](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/tag/Users#operation/getSearchUsers)

</LearnMore>

To add additional attribute values to your filter, click on the attribute name and select the additional values from the menu. The list displays only users that match all of the attribute values you selected:

To remove a filter, click on the attribute name you want to stop filtering by and choose "Clear filter."

### Customizing the Users list

You can customize which attributes appear on the **Users** list. To start, click the **Attributes** button.

Here is a screenshot of the **Attributes** button on the list:

The **Attributes** menu lets you choose standard or custom attributes to appear on the **Users** list. After you choose specific attributes, that view persists when you visit the list in the future.

## Modifying feature flags for a user

Click a user to manage the feature flags that apply to them, view the segments they are in, and view a full list of their attributes.

To modify a feature flag the user receives:

1. From the **Users** list click the user you wish to modify. Their user page appears, with their unique attributes on the left and their expected flag variations on the right.
2. Select a new variation from the **Variation** menu next to the flag you want to update:

3. (Optional) To remove individual targeting, either:
  - change to the variation from the **Variation** dropdown, or
  - click the "Target match" link to remove the individual target from the flag's **Targeting** tab.
4. Click **Save changes**.

## User storage

The **Users** list shows only cached user information. A user will appear on the list for 30 days after a flag sends an `identify` or `flag evaluation` event for them. Each time a flag sends a new event for the user, the 30-day period starts over.

After 30 days with no new `identify` or `flag evaluation` events, users age out of the system and their information no longer appears on the list.

After a user ages out of the system, they will reappear on the list if a flag sends an `identify` or `flag evaluation` event for them again. The exception to this is if your account has reached the maximum number of users.

If you want to keep users on the list for longer than 30 days between flags sending `identify` or `flag evaluation` events, you can manually call `identify` for all of the users that you wish to retain. To learn how to do this in your SDK, read [Identifying and changing users](/sdk/features/identify).

Accounts are limited to 100,000,000 users. If you reach the users limit, flag evaluations will still work for new users, but those users won't appear on the list until stale users age out of the 30-day user cache and your users drop below 100,000,000. To learn more, read [Understanding client-side MAU limits](/home/billing/usage-metrics#understanding-client-side-mau-limits).

If you want to increase your client-side Monthly Active Users (MAU) limit and include more users from your client-side SDKs on the list, contact [Support](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

## Removing a user

You can delete individual users from the **Users** list by clicking the **overflow menu** and choosing "Delete." You can also delete users by opening their user page and clicking **Delete**.

Deleting users from the list does not decrease your Monthly Active User (MAU) count.
