## Overview

This topic explains how to build and manage the Standard user segments. Standard segments let you target groups of users by attribute.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Managing Big Segments</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The contents on this page are only applicable to standard segments. To learn how to create and manage Big Segments, read [Big Segments](/home/users/big-segments).

## Customizing user segments

You can customize a segment to apply to different users or attributes, or exclude users and attributes, in the segment's **Targeting** tab. Segment targeting rules function the same way as flag targeting rules. To learn more, read [Targeting users](/home/flags/targeting-users).

To customize a segment:

1. Navigate to the **Targeting** tab of the user segment you wish to modify.
2. Target individual users, or lists of users, with the **Included users** or **Excluded users** options.
3. Click **+ Add rules** to create a custom rule for this segment. The custom rule menu appears:

![A user segment with the "+ Add rules" button called out.](segments-add-rules-callout.png)

4. Specify an **attribute**, an **operator**, and **values** for the rule.
5. If you want to add more criteria, click the **plus button** beside the rule criteria:

6. Choose a variation from the **Serve** menu.
7. Click **Review and save**.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Understanding segment rule logic</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

When you specify rules for a segment, LaunchDarkly parses them in order of appearance from top to bottom. You can change how segment targeting applies based on the order of the rules you create.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

You can target the same user segment from multiple feature flags. If you have many flags that need the same targeting rules, it may be easier to set up a single user segment with those rules for your flags to target, rather than setting up the rules repeatedly in each flag.

## Targeting individual users

You can target individual users for inclusion in or exclusion from a segment.

To target an individual user:

1. Navigate to the **Segments** dashboard and choose the segment you wish to modify.
2. In the "Included users" or "Excluded users" section, search for the user you want to include or exclude by searching for their name or key in the **Add users** field.
3. Click the user name or key. The user is now individually targeted within the segment.

Here is an image of an individually targeted user:

You can remove all included or excluded users from a segment by clicking the **overflow menu** and selecting "Clear targets."

## Bulk editing users

If you have a long list of users you want to add, remove, or replace within a segment, you can bulk edit users from a segment's **Targeting** tab.

To edit users in bulk:

1. Navigate to the **Segments** dashboard and choose the segment you wish to modify.
2. In the "Included users" or "Excluded users" section, click the **overflow menu**.
3. Select "Bulk edit." A "Bulk editing users" dialog appears.
4. Use the menu to do one of the following actions:
  - "Add" adds the selected users as targets to the variation
  - "Remove" removes the selected users from the target variation
  - "Replace" replaces all currently targeted users with the selected users
5. Enter a list of user keys or email addresses in the **these users** field, separated by a comma or new line. LaunchDarkly looks up users by key or email and displays them in the list on the right. If you want to target a user that has not yet been encountered by LaunchDarkly, you must enter their key.

![The "Bulk editing included users" dialog with "Add" selected and users added.](segments-bulk-editing.png)

You can update the list on the right before you perform the selected action. The options for updating the list include the following:

- **All** represents all of the users that may be impacted by the action, whether they are added or removed. Check the user's checkbox for the action to apply.
- **The checkmark** represents inputted user keys that currently match users in the system. For example, if you enter the user key `bob@example.com`, and `bob@example.com` already exists in LaunchDarkly, they will show up in this list.
- **The question mark** represents users with no matching records in LaunchDarkly. If you are adding users and the users do not currently exist in LaunchDarkly, they will be added to the targeting list.
- **The exclamation mark** represents user key inputs with multiple matching records. For example, if you enter the email address `bob@example.com`, but there are multiple user keys that have `bob@example.com` as an email address, the system may return multiple matching records. You can select the correct record by clicking the checkbox.
- **Current** lists all of the currently targeted users for the variation.

6. Click **Add N users**, **Remove N users**, or **Replace N users** to perform the selected action.

## Exporting user segments

You can export the users within a segment to a CSV file for use in other systems.

To export included or excluded users within a segment to a CSV file:

1. Navigate to the **Segments** dashboard and choose the segment you wish to export.
2. In the "Included users" or "Excluded users" section, click the **overflow menu**.
3. Click "Export as CSV." A CSV file including the list of user keys the segment is targeted to downloads to your machine.


## Scheduling user removal from segments

<Callout intent="primary">
<CalloutTitle>Scheduling removal dates is an Enterprise feature</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Scheduling removal dates is available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

You can schedule a date and time on which LaunchDarkly removes a user from a segment. You can do this for existing users, or when you create a new one.

This is useful if you want to give users temporary access to a feature that has their segment targeted. The ability to remove users from segments, instead of flag targeting, allows you to keep your flag's targeting rules permanent and clean.

To set a targeting removal date:

1. Navigate to the **Segments** dashboard and choose the segment you wish to modify.
2. In the **Included users** field, click the user you wish to remove from the segment:

![The "Target individual users" section.](segments-remove-user-on.png)

3. In the "Remove user on" section, click "never" to expand a calendar view:

![The removal scheduling calendar.](segments-schedule-calendar.png)

4. Set a date and time for the user to be removed from the segment.
5. Click **Apply**.
6. Click **Save changes**.

Additionally, when you add a user to a segment, you can schedule them for removal later by clicking **Add + schedule removal**.

Here is an image of the user targeting field:
