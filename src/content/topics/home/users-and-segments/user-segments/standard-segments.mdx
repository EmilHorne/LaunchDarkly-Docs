## Overview

This topic explains how to customize and manage standard user segments. Standard segments let you target groups of users by attribute. To learn how to build standard segments, read [Creating user segments](/home/users/segments#creating-user-segments).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Managing Big Segments</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The contents on this page are only applicable to standard segments. To learn how to create and manage Big Segments, read [Big Segments](/home/users/big-segments).

## Customizing user segments

You can customize a segment to apply to different users or attributes, or exclude users and attributes, in the segment's **Targeting** tab. Segment targeting rules function the same way as flag targeting rules. To learn more, read [Targeting users](/home/flags/targeting-users).

To customize a segment:

1. Navigate to the **Targeting** tab of the user segment you wish to modify.
2. Individually target users, or lists of users, with the **Included users** or **Excluded users** options.
3. Click **+ Add rules** to create a custom rule for this segment. The custom rule menu appears:

![A user segment with the "+ Add rules" button called out.](segments-add-rules-callout.png)

4. Specify an **attribute**, an **operator**, and **values** for the rule.
5. If you want to add more criteria, click the **plus button** beside the rule criteria.

6. Select whether to include in the segment all users that match the rule, or a percentage of users that match the rule.
  - If you select a percentage of users, enter the percentage to include in the segment.
7. Click **Save**.

When you specify rules for a segment, LaunchDarkly parses them in order of appearance from top to bottom. You can change how segment targeting applies based on the order of the rules you create.

### Targeting a segment in multiple flags

You can target the same user segment from multiple feature flags. If you have many flags that need the same targeting rules, it may be easier to set up a single user segment with those rules for your flags to target, rather than setting up the rules repeatedly in each flag.

If you target only a percentage of users that match your segment targeting rule, each flag that targets that segment will include the same users in its targeting, assuming there are no other differences between the flags' targeting rules.

For example, imagine you configure a segment to target 50% of users that match its rule. As a result, the segment includes users `Adrian`, `Bailey`, and `Cristiano`, and excludes users `DJ`, `Ellis`, and `Felicia`. If there are no other differences between the flags' targeting rules, each flag that targets that segment will also include users `Adrian`, `Bailey`, and `Cristiano` in its targeting, while excluding users `DJ`, `Ellis`, and `Felicia`.

## Targeting individual users

You can individually target users for inclusion in or exclusion from a segment.

To individually target a user:

1. Navigate to the **Segments** dashboard and choose the segment you wish to modify.
2. In the "Included users" or "Excluded users" section, search for the user you want to include or exclude by searching for their name or key in the **Add users** field.
3. Click the user name or key. The user is now individually targeted within the segment.

Here is an image of an individually targeted user:

You can remove all included or excluded users from a segment by clicking the **overflow menu** and selecting "Clear targets."

If you're on an Enterprise plan, you can also bulk edit segments to make changes to multiple users simultaneously. To learn more, read [Bulk editing users in segments](/home/users/bulk-edit-segments).

## Exporting user segments

You can export the users within a segment to a CSV file for use in other systems.

To export included or excluded users within a segment to a CSV file:

1. Navigate to the **Segments** dashboard and choose the segment you wish to export.
2. In the "Included users" or "Excluded users" section, click the **overflow menu**.
3. Click "Export as CSV." A CSV file including the list of user keys the segment is targeted to downloads to your machine.


## Scheduling user removal from segments

<Callout intent="primary">
<CalloutTitle>Scheduling removal dates is an Enterprise feature</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Scheduling removal dates is available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

You can schedule a date and time on which LaunchDarkly removes a user from a segment. You can do this for existing users, or when you create a new one.

This is useful if you want to give users temporary access to a feature that has their segment targeted. The ability to remove users from segments, instead of flag targeting, allows you to keep your flag's targeting rules permanent and clean.

To set a targeting removal date:

1. Navigate to the **Segments** dashboard and choose the segment you wish to modify.
2. In the **Included users** field, click the user you wish to remove from the segment:

![The "Individual targeting" section.](segments-remove-user-on.png)

3. In the "Remove user on" section, click "never" to expand a calendar view:

![The removal scheduling calendar.](segments-schedule-calendar.png)

4. Set a date and time for the user to be removed from the segment.
5. Click **Apply**.
6. Click **Save changes**.

Additionally, when you add a user to a segment, you can schedule them for removal later by clicking **Add + schedule removal**.
