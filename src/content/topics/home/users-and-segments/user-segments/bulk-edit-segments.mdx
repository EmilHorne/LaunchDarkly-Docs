## Overview

If you have a long list of users you want to add, remove, or replace within a segment, you can bulk edit users from a segment's **Targeting** tab.

To edit users in bulk:

1. Navigate to the **Segments** list and choose the segment you wish to modify.
2. In the "Included users" or "Excluded users" section, click the **overflow menu**.
3. Select "Bulk edit." A "Bulk editing users" dialog appears.
4. Use the menu to do one of the following actions:
  - "Add" adds the selected users as targets to the variation
  - "Remove" removes the selected users from the target variation
  - "Replace" replaces all currently targeted users with the selected users
5. Enter a list of user keys or email addresses in the **these users** field, separated by a comma or new line. LaunchDarkly looks up users by key or email and displays them in the list on the right. If you want to target a user that has not yet been encountered by LaunchDarkly, you must enter their key.

You can update the list on the right before you perform the selected action. The options for updating the list include the following:

- **All** represents all of the users that may be impacted by the action, whether they are added or removed. Check the user's checkbox for the action to apply.
- **The checkmark** represents inputted user keys that currently match users in the system. For example, if you enter the user key `bob@example.com`, and `bob@example.com` already exists in LaunchDarkly, they will show up in this list.
- **The question mark** represents users with no matching records in LaunchDarkly. If you are adding users and the users do not currently exist in LaunchDarkly, they will be added to the targeting list.
- **The exclamation mark** represents user key inputs with multiple matching records. For example, if you enter the email address `bob@example.com`, but there are multiple user keys that have `bob@example.com` as an email address, the system may return multiple matching records. You can select the correct record by clicking the checkbox.
- **Current** lists all of the currently targeted users for the variation.

6. Click **Add N users**, **Remove N users**, or **Replace N users** to perform the selected action.
