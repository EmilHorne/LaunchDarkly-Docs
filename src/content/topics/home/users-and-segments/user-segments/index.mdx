## Overview

This topic explains how to build and manage user segments. User segments let you target groups of users by attribute.

## Understanding user segments

User segments are lists of users that you can use to manage flag targeting behavior in bulk. Segments are useful for keeping groups of users, like `beta-users` or `enterprise-customers`, up to date. They allow you to more quickly turn features on or off for certain groups with confidence.

There are some differences between flag and segment targeting that you should be aware of:

- Unlike flags, segments are environment-specific. They do not populate in environments other than the one you created them in.
- Segment targeting cannot reference another user segment.

LaunchDarkly supports two types of segments:

* Standard segments
* Big Segments, including Big Segments synced with Amplitude

### Understanding segment types

There are a few differences between Big Segments and standard segments.

These differences include:

* Standard segments are built to support segments with 15,000 or fewer users. Big Segments are built to support millions of users. You cannot convert a segment from one kind to another after you create it, so choose the kind that best suits your use case when you create it.
* A Big Segment is backed by an external data store and has [additional prerequisites](/home/users/big-segments#prerequisites).
* Big Segments support uploading users from a CSV.
* Big Segments do not support user inclusion rules.

## Using the Segments dashboard

You can view standard and Big Segments on the **Segments** dashboard.

From the dashboard, you can filter segments to display only those synced from Amplitude.

## Creating user segments

To create a new segment:

1. Navigate to the **Segments** dashboard.
2. Click **Create segment**. The "Create a segment" panel appears:

3. Give your segment a human-readable **Name**.
4. Enter a **Key** for the segment. This field auto-populates based on the segment name, but you can change it if you need to.
5. (Optional) Add a **Description**.
6. (Optional) Choose **Tags** from the menu.
7. Check the **Big segment** checkbox to create a Big Segment.

Big Segments have different requirements and capabilities than standard segments. To learn more, read [Understanding segment types](#understanding-segment-types)

8. Click **Save segment**. The segment's **Targeting** tab appears.

You can further edit the segment's settings from its **Settings** tab.
