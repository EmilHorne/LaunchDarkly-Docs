## Overview

This topic explains what user attributes are, how they impact what you receive in LaunchDarkly, how to configure them, and how LaunchDarkly uses them to calculate and display flag settings for users.

## Understanding user attributes

Users are people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your app. Any identifier that uniquely corresponds to a target can be designated as a user.

A more precise way to refer to one user is as a "user object." A user object is a collection of a user's built-in and custom user attributes, identified by a unique user key. It includes all of the information about a user that LaunchDarkly can use in a feature flag evaluation.

LaunchDarkly provides built-in attribute fields for you to fill in, but the SDK does not automatically collect any information. The exceptions to this are the `os` and `device` attributes used by mobile SDKs. If you want to target your users based on any other built-in attributes, you must supply their values.

All built-in user attributes are strings with the exception of `anonymous`:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>Attribute&nbsp;key</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Attribute example value</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Notes</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>key</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>"1f2e2d3a"</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Required for evaluation. This should be unique for each user.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>secondary</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>"2398127"</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        If provided, this attribute is used with a user's <code>key</code> to generate a variation in percentage rollouts.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>ip</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>"10.10.10.10"</TableCell>
      <TableCell>This attribute should be a valid IP address.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>email</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>"user@example.com"</TableCell>
      <TableCell></TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>name</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>"Jill Jones"</TableCell>
      <TableCell></TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>avatar</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>"http://example.com/avatar.png"</TableCell>
      <TableCell>This attribute must be an absolute URL to an avatar image for the user. The avatar appears on the <strong>Users</strong> dashboard.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>firstName</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>"Jill"</TableCell>
      <TableCell></TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>lastName</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>"Jones"</TableCell>
      <TableCell></TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>country</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>"Uganda"</TableCell>
      <TableCell></TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>anonymous</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>"true"</TableCell>
      <TableCell>This can be a boolean or string value. This attribute prevents the user from appearing on the dashboard. If the anonymous attribute is set to <em>any</em> value other than boolean <code>false</code> or null, LaunchDarkly treats the user as anonymous.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>os</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>25</TableCell>
      <TableCell>This attribute is available only in mobile SDKs. The mobile SDK automatically provides a value for the attribute.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>device</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>"Pixel XL marlin"</TableCell>
      <TableCell>This attribute is available only in mobile SDKs. The mobile SDK automatically provides a value for the attribute.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

The user key is the only mandatory user attribute. All other user attributes are optional.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Creating searchable user keys</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You can structure your user keys so they are both searchable and unique. To do this, we suggest adding a searchable term to the beginning of the key, followed by a unique ID. For example, if you wanted to easily search users that encountered a specific service, you could structure they key as follows: `service_name:uuid`.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

You can view a user's attributes by clicking on the individual user from the [Users dashboard](https://app.launchdarkly.com/users).

## Viewing and managing users

By default, all of the attributes in your user objects are sent to LaunchDarkly. This data lets LaunchDarkly calculate the current flag settings for users and powers the autocomplete functionality throughout the LaunchDarkly UI.

You can change the value of an attribute for a user object at any point. To learn more, read [Identifying and changing users](/sdk/features/identify).

You can access user pages from the **Users** dashboard. To learn how, read [The Users dashboard](/home/users/users-dashboard).

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>The SDK does not use the attributes on the <strong>Users</strong> dashboard to evaluate flags</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The SDK only evaluates flags based on the user object you provide in the evaluation call. The SDK does not use the attributes shown on the dashboard, and user attributes are not synchronized across SDK instances. You must provide all applicable user attributes for your targeting rules to apply correctly. To learn more, read [Evaluating flags](/sdk/features/evaluating).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Creating private user attributes

You may not want to send all attributes back to, or store all attributes in, LaunchDarkly. The security or data protection requirements of your organization may require you to limit what customer or user data is transmitted to or stored within a third-party platform like LaunchDarkly.

For example, you may want to target customers by their personally identifying information (PII), such as their email address. You can mark the email address attribute as private, but still use it in targeting rules and segments. If you are using a server-side SDK, the SDK will not send the private attribute back to LaunchDarkly. 

If you are using a client-side SDK, the SDK will send the private attribute back to LaunchDarkly for evaluation. However, the SDK won't send the attribute to LaunchDarkly in events data, LaunchDarkly won't store the private attribute, and the private attribute will not appear on the **Users** dashboard.

### Configuring private attribute settings in your SDK

There are three different ways to configure private attributes:

- You can mark _all_ attributes private globally in the `LDClient` configuration object.
- You can mark specific attributes private by name globally in the `LdClient` configuration object.
- You can mark specific attributes private by name for individual users when you construct `LDUser` objects.

User keys cannot be marked private.

If you initially mark an attribute as private, LaunchDarkly will continue to treat the attribute as private in subsequent evaluations as long as the user is on the dashboard, even if you later remove the "private" designation from the attribute. If you no longer want LaunchDarkly to treat the attribute as private, remove the "private" designation, delete the user from the **Users** dashboard, and re-evaluate the user.

The dashboard indicates private attributes with a lock icon:

![The "Users" dashboard with a private attribute called out.](users-private-attribute-callout.png)

To learn more about setting these configuration options, read your SDK's documentation.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Implications of using private attributes</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If a feature flag contains targeting rules that reference private attributes, user pages may not be able to calculate flag settings for your users. Each user page indicates when it is unable to calculate flag settings because of private attributes.
<br />
When creating a targeting rule, LaunchDarkly cannot autocomplete attributes you have made private.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Setting custom user attributes

Custom attributes contain any other user data that you would like to use to conditionally target your users. You can provide custom attributes in the user object.

The value of a custom attribute can be of the following types:

* boolean
* number
* string
* array

You should not set the value of a custom attribute to a JSON object. If you do, it won't appear on the **Users** dashboard.

You can set custom attributes by configuring user objects within your SDK. If you create a custom attribute on the dashboard, you can add the attribute to flag targeting rules, but flag evaluations won't be able to use the attribute until you configure it within your SDK. To learn how, read [User configuration](/sdk/features/user-config).

Custom attributes are environment-specific. They are not shared between environments or projects.

Here is an example user object which contains custom user attributes:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'User object with custom attributes', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
{
"key":"YOUR-USER-KEY",
"firstName": "Bob"
"custom":{
	"groups":[
		"YOUR-COMPANY",
		"YOUR-COMPANY-GROUP-2"
		]
	}
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

There is no limit to the number of custom attributes. However, adding custom attributes does increase the size of the user object. JavaScript-based client-side SDKs send the user object during initialization, so a large number of custom attributes may mean it takes longer for the SDK to finish initializing. To learn more, read [Initializing the client](/sdk/client-side/javascript#initializing-the-client).
