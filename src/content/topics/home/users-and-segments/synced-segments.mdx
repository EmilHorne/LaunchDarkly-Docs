Syncing segments from Amplitude cohorts is only available to members of LaunchDarkly's Early Access Program (EAP). If you want access to this feature, [join the EAP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJ5qCC_RZTW9pPSXVZk9HaKzpltNAeoQb2t6gh7dLicwQWQQ/viewform).

## Overview

This topic explains how to create Big Segments that sync with an Amplitude cohort. Syncing segments let you import audiences from Amplitude to LaunchDarkly to more efficiently target and deliver feature flags.

The benefits of syncing segments with Amplitude is the automatic syncing between Amplitude and LaunchDarkly.
This lets you concentrate more on deploying features and less on managing users between platforms.

The prerequisites for Big Segments apply to syncing segments. To learn more, read [Using Big Segments](/home/users/big-segments#using-big-segments).

## Prerequisites

In order to sync segments, you must meet the following prerequisites:

- You must have an Amplitude account with the LaunchDarkly integration enabled. Contact your Amplitude Customer Success Manager to enable the LaunchDarkly integration.
- You must have a LaunchDarkly access token with write access for the project you want to connect to Amplitude.
- You must have a LaunchDarkly client-side ID for the environment you want to connect to Amplitude.
- If you are using server-side SDKs, or client-side SDKs with the Relay Proxy, there are additional prerequisites. To learn more, read [Using Big Segments](/home/users/big-segments#using-big-segments).

## Understanding syncing segments

By syncing segments, you can connect a new or existing Amplitude cohort to LaunchDarkly. LaunchDarkly interprets this cohort as a user segment, which makes it convenient for you to target flags to specific user groups or demographics.

In the past, the only option to import a user segment from a third-party tool was to manually upload a CSV file or configure users through the LaunchDarkly API.

You can configure segments to sync automatically in LaunchDarkly at regular intervals, which keeps them current with the existing cohort. We recommend setting up your segment to sync every hour. The process for doing this is documented below.

By syncing segments, you can deliver flags to the right user groups precisely and on time.

## Creating a Big Segment that syncs with Amplitude

To configure a Big Segment that syncs with an Amplitude cohort, you must choose a cohort in Amplitude and tell it to send data to LaunchDarkly. When you do this correctly, the cohort appears as a user segment in LaunchDarkly.

To do this, first [add LaunchDarkly as a destination](#adding-launchdarkly-as-a-destination) and then [sync the cohort](#sync-cohort-to-launchdarkly) to the LaunchDarkly destination.

## Adding LaunchDarkly as a destination

1. Log in to Amplitude and navigate to Sources & Destinations.

![The Amplitude dashboard with the "Sources & Destinations" button called out.](../../images/segments-amplitude-sources-destinations.png)

2. Navigate to the **Destinations** tab and click **Add Destination**.

![The Destinations tab with the "Add Destination" button called out.](../../images/segments-amplitude-add-destination.png)

3. Select the LaunchDarkly Destination. To create a destination in Amplitude, you must have Admin or Manager credentials. If you do not have Admin or Manager credentials Amplitude displays an error message.

  If you don't see LaunchDarkly on the destinations list, contact your Amplitude Customer Success Manager to enable the LaunchDarkly integration.

4. Enter a destination name and add the **access token** and **client-side ID** for your LaunchDarkly project and environment. Select a matching user property in Amplitude to map to LaunchDarkly's User Key. This will most likely be your Amplitude user ID but it depends on your [Amplitude configuration](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/206404628-Step-2-Identifying-your-users). Click save.

5. Verify that LaunchDarkly shows as **Connected**.

## Sync cohort to LaunchDarkly

To connect a cohort to LaunchDarkly:

1. Navigate to the cohort you wish to connect to LaunchDarkly.
2. Click **Sync to...** This opens a new tab with a modal.

![The SuccessCohort screen with the "Sync to..." button called out.](../../images/segments-amplitude-sync.png)

3. Select **Experiment** then **LaunchDarkly** then **next**. If you don't see the LaunchDarkly destination, make sure you have [added LaunchDarkly as a destination](#adding-launchdarkly-as-a-destination). This takes you to the destination configuration screen.

![The "Select Sync Type" screen.](../../images/segments-amplitude-select-sync-type.png)

4. Select your **LaunchDarkly destination** and set the scheduled sync frequency to **hourly**. Click **Sync**. An hourly sync frequency ensures your segments are kept up to date with your Amplitude cohorts. A one-time sync exports the cohort into a Big Segment once.

![The Amplitude destination configuration screen.](../../images/segments-amplitude-destination-config.png)

5. The sync process begins and might take a few minutes to complete. When the sync finishes Amplitude sends you an email and LaunchDarkly appears in the list of Destinations connected to that cohort.

## Viewing synced Amplitude cohorts in LaunchDarkly

You can view your synced Amplitude cohort as a segment in LaunchDarkly. It appears in the **Segments** tab with the Amplitude logo in its name.

Here is an image of the Segments dashboard:

Click into that segment to see details about its targeting. You can't edit rules for a Big Segment synced with an Amplitude cohort because they are managed by Amplitude.
