## Overview

This topic explains how to build and manage user segments. User segments let you target groups of users by attribute.

## Understanding user segments

User segments are lists of users that you can use to manage flag targeting behavior in bulk. You can include or exclude individual users from a segment based on user attributes. Use the **Segments** dashboard to create targeting rules and lists of users to manage flag targeting more efficiently.

Segments are useful for keeping groups of users, like `beta-users` or `enterprise-customers`, up to date. They allow you to more quickly turn features on or off for certain groups with confidence.

There are some differences between flag and segment targeting that you should be aware of:

- Unlike flags, segments are environment-specific. They do not populate in environments other than the one you created them in.
- Segment targeting cannot reference another user segment.

## Creating user segments

Creating a segment is similar to creating a flag.

To add a new segment:

1. Navigate to the **Segments** dashboard.
2. Click **Create segment**. The "Create a segment" panel appears:

3. Give your segment a human-readable **Name**.
4. Enter a **Key** for the segment. This field auto-populates based on the segment name, but you can change it if you need to.
5. (Optional) Add a **Description**.
6. (Optional) Choose **Tags** from the menu.
7. Click **Save segment**. The Segment's **Targeting** tab appears:

## Customizing a user segment

You can customize a segment to apply to different users or attributes, or exclude users and attributes, in the segment's **Targeting** tab. Segment targeting rules function the same way as flag targeting rules. To learn more, read [Targeting users](/home/flags/targeting-users).

To customize a segment:

1. Navigate to the **Targeting** tab of the user segment you wish to modify.
2. Target individual users, or lists of users, with the **Included users** or **Excluded users** options.
3. Click **+ Add rules** to create a custom rule for this segment. The custom rule menu appears:

![A user segment with the "Add rules" button called out.](segments-add-rules-callout.png)

4. Specify an **attribute**, an **operator**, and **values** for the rule.
5. If you want to add more criteria, click the **plus button** beside the rule criteria:

6. Choose a variation from the **Serve** menu.
7. Click **Save changes**.

When you specify rules for a segment, LaunchDarkly parses them in order of appearance from top to bottom. You can change how segment targeting applies based on the order of the rules you create.

You can target the same user segment from multiple feature flags. If you have many flags that need the same targeting rules, it may be easier to set up a single user segment with those rules for your flags to target, rather than setting up the rules repeatedly in each flag.

## Scheduling user removal from segments

Scheduling removal dates is available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

You can schedule a date and time on which LaunchDarkly removes a user from a segment. You can do this for existing users, or when you create a new one.

This is useful if you want to give users temporary access to a feature that has their segment targeted. The ability to remove users from segments, instead of flag targeting, allows you to keep your flag's targeting rules permanent and clean.

To set a targeting removal date:

1. Navigate to the **Segments** dashboard and choose the segment you wish to modify.
2. In the **Included users** field, click the user you wish to remove from the segment:

![The "Target individual users" section.](segments-remove-user-on.png)

3. In the "Remove user on" section, click "never" to expand a calendar view:

![The removal scheduling calendar.](segments-schedule-calendar.png)

4. Set a date and time for the user to be removed from the segment.
5. Click **Apply**.
6. Click **Save changes**.

Additionally, when you add a user to a segment, you can schedule them for removal later by clicking **Add + schedule removal**.
