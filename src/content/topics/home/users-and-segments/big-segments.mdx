## Overview

This topic explains what Big Segments are and how to use them.

A Big Segment is a kind of segment that is backed by an external data store. Big Segments can support massive numbers of targets. The maximum number of targets is dictated only by the limits of the data store you configure it with. A standard user segment is capped at 50,000 users. To use Big Segments, you must meet [additional prerequisites](#prerequisites).

There are two ways to configure a Big Segment. A single segment can use one of the two methods, but not both.

Here's how to configure a Big Segment:

1. Configure a segment to sync with an Amplitude cohort, or
2. Use the Big Segment import feature.

To learn more about user segments, read [Building user segments](/home/users/segments).

## Syncing Big Segments

You can sync Big Segments from an Amplitude cohort. When you sync your Amplitude cohort to the LaunchDarkly destination in the Amplitude dashboard, it creates a synced segment. This allows the segment to contain a large number of users from Amplitude.

To learn more, read [Syncing segments from Amplitude cohorts](/home/users/synced-segments).

## Importing and exporting Big Segments

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>This feature is for Early Access Program customers only
</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

The ability to import to or export from a Big Segment is only available to members of LaunchDarkly's Early Access Program (EAP). If you want access to this feature, [join the EAP](http://launchdarkly.com/eap).
  </CalloutDescription>

[//]: # (TODO - Upon GA, the guidance around whether to use the checkbox should probably move to the main segments paged, linked to here, and this section can just cover import/export.  The screenshot for segment creation will need to be updated.)

You can import and export directly to and from LaunchDarkly Big Segments using CSV files. The import/export feature is not available for synced Big Segments.

If you want to import or export from a Big Segment, you must designate the segment as a Big Segment when you create it. To learn more about creating segments, read [Segments](/home/users/segments).

### Importing users

To import users from a CSV file:

1. Navigate to the Big Segment you wish to import users to.
2. Click **Upload CSV**:

3. Select a CSV file from your computer.
4. Click **Upload File**.

The import process begins in the background. When the import completes successfully, you receive an email notification. Depending on the number of users in the CSV, this may take several minutes.

### Limitations in the EAP version of this feature

There are some limitations to the import/export feature. They are:

1. When you import to a Big Segment from a CSV file, the contents of the CSV file replaces the current set of users. This means current users will be erased if they are not in the CSV file.
2. The imported CSV file must not contain a header row. LaunchDarkly reads user keys from the first column of the CSV file.

For example:

4. Import/export of **Excluded users** is not supported.
5. Concurrent imports within a single [environment](/home/organize/environments) are not supported.
6. Uploaded CSV files may not exceed 10MB in size and may not contain more than 500K users.

### Exporting users

To initiate an CSV export of the members of a Big Segment:

1. Navigate to the desired segment.
2. Click on the **overflow menu** and select **Export as CSV**:

The export process runs in the background. When it completes, you receive an email notification containing a link to where you can download your CSV file.


## Prerequisites

To use Big Segments, you must meet the following prerequisites:

- You must properly configure the Relay Proxy:
    - If you use server-side SDKs, you must use the Relay Proxy and it must be configured to use Big Segments.
    - If you use client-side SDKs, the Relay Proxy is not required. However, if you do use the Relay Proxy, you must configure it to use Big Segments. To learn more, read [Using the Relay Proxy](/home/relay-proxy/using).
- You must configure your SDKs to use Big Segments:
    - If you use server-side SDKs, you must use an SDK version that supports Big Segments. To learn more, read the [Big Segments SDK documentation](/sdk/features/big-segments).
    - All client-side SDKs support Big Segments by default, so there's no additional setup required for client-side SDKs.
