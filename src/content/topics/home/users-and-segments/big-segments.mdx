## Overview

This topic explains what Big Segments are and how to use them.

A Big Segment is a kind of segment that is backed by an external data store. Big Segments can support massive numbers of targets. The maximum number of targets is dictated only by the limits of the data store you configure it with. A standard user segment is capped at 50,000 users. To use Big Segments, you must meet additional prerequisites. To learn more, read [Using Big Segments](#using-big-segments).

To learn more about user segments, read [Building user segments](/home/users/segments).

## Syncing Big Segments

You can sync Big Segments from an Amplitude cohort. When you sync your Amplitude cohort to the LaunchDarkly destination in the Amplitude dashboard, it creates a synced segment. This allows the segment to contain a large number of users from Amplitude.

The same prerequisites for Big Segments apply to Big Segments that are synced from an Amplitude cohort. To learn more, read [Syncing segments from Amplitude cohorts](/home/users/synced-segments).

## Using Big Segments

To use Big Segments, you must meet the following prerequisites:

- You must properly configure the Relay Proxy:
    - If you use server-side SDKs, you must use the Relay Proxy and it must be configured to use Big Segments.
    - If you use client-side SDKs, the Relay Proxy is not required. However, if you do use the Relay Proxy, you must configure it to use Big Segments. To learn more, read [Using the Relay Proxy](/home/relay-proxy/using).
- You must configure your SDKs to use Big Segments:
    - If you use server-side SDKs, you must use a version that supports Big Segments and correctly configure it. To learn how, read [Big Segments](/sdk/features/big-segments).
    - All client-side SDKs support Big Segments by default, so there's no additional setup required for client-side SDKs.
