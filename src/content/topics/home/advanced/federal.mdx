## Overview

This topic explains how the version of LaunchDarkly that is available on domains controlled by the United States government is different from the version of LaunchDarkly available to the general public. If you are an employee or contractor for a United States federal agency and use LaunchDarkly in your work, you likely use the federal instance of LaunchDarkly. This instance is compliant with the United States government's Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP).

In order to maintain FedRAMP compliance, LaunchDarkly's federal instance uses enhanced infrastructure and security configurations compared to the generally available instance of LaunchDarkly. Many components that function automatically in the generally available instance instead use encryption, authentication, or require authorization to perform functions in the federal instance. In addition, third-party components that are federally compliant, such as AWS and Datadog, have policies and agents enabled to maintain compliance when connecting to LaunchDarkly.

## Understanding which features are available to the federal instance

The LaunchDarkly federal instance has near-parity with the generally available LaunchDarkly instance. There are some exceptions, which are explained below.

The federal instance includes:

* Core flagging features through the LaunchDarkly application and [API](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com)
* [Code references](/home/code/code-references), if the `ld-find-code-refs` utility is [compiled with FIPS 140-2 support](/home/code/code-references/#using-code-references-in-federal-environments)
* Customer metrics
* [Data Export](/home/data-export) to [Azure Event Hubs](/home/data-export/event-hub) and [Amazon Kinesis](/home/data-export/kinesis) destinations
* [Experimentation](/home/experimentation)
* [The Relay Proxy](/home/relay-proxy)
* [SDKs](/sdk)

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Federal instance URLs end in ".us"</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>
  
The federal instance does not use the common ".com" URL path. Instead, it uses the US government's path: ".us." When you navigate to LaunchDarkly Federal application, use the federal instance API, or initialize your SDK to the federal instance, you must replace the generally available ".com" URLs with URLs that end in ".us." 

Initialization of SDKs to the federal instance is performed in the initialization "options" settings for the SDK. Configuration options can be found in the generated API reference for each SDK. 

For example, the initialization options for the Node SDK are here. Depending on the SDK, there may be multiple service endpoints required to be configured in the initialization options. These could include the base/polling endpoint, streaming endpoint, and an events endpoint. 

Note the option key value pair names may differ between SDKs as we respect each language's URI/URL naming conventions and supported services. So, it is critical to reference the documentation for each specific SDK. 

Sample code is provided below for reference to highlight differences.
 
Here is an example for the React SDK:
  
  <CodeTabs
defaultValue="json"
values={[
  { label: 'json', value: 'json', },
]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
  async () => {
  // Set clientSideID to your own Client-side ID. You can find this in
  // your LaunchDarkly portal under Account settings / Projects
  const LDProvider = await asyncWithLDProvider({
     clientSideID: 'your-client-side-ID-here',
     user: {
       "key":"samplekey", "name":"First Last", "email":"example@yourdomain.com"
     },
    options: {
       baseUrl:"https://sdk.launchdarkly.us",
       streamUrl:"https://clientstream.launchdarkly.us",
       eventsUrl:"https://events.launchdarkly.us"
    },
    deferInitialization: false
});
 
  Java example (server-side SDKs normally require streaming and events settings, not polling):
 
LDConfig config = new LDConfig.Builder()
  .dataSource(Components.streamingDataSource()
    .baseURI(URI.create("https://stream.launchdarkly.us"))
  .events(Components.sendEvents()
    .baseURI(URI.create("https://events.launchdarkly.us"))
  .build();
 
For additional language syntax examples for setting configuration options, read [Using proxy mode](sdk/features/relay-proxy-configuration/proxy-mode). To use the examples, change the Relay Proxy URL to the respective federal instance URLs. A list of available service endpoints for the federal instance is below.

Please note that if application or network layer firewalls are in use on your network, they will need to allowlist these URLs for LaunchDarkly to function properly.

For example:

* https://app.launchdarkly.us
* https://clientsdk.launchdarkly.us
* https://clientstream.launchdarkly.us
* https://events.launchdarkly.us
* https://sdk.launchdarkly.us
* https://stream.launchdarkly.us

## Understanding which features have minimal support or are unsupported

FedRAMP-compliant integrations are available on the federal instance of LaunchDarkly. This is because integrations connect LaunchDarkly to other systems and move data between them, so connected systems must also be FedRAMP-compliant.

The federal instance supports the following integrations:

* [Datadog](/integrations/datadog)
* [Dynatrace](/integrations/dynatrace)
* [New Relic One](/integrations/new-relic)
* [Slack](/integrations/slack)
* [Splunk](/integrations/splunk)
* [Terraform](/integrations/terraform)

The federal instance does not include:

* [The debugger](/home/flags/debugger)
* [Support for the Roku SDK](/sdk/client-side/roku)
* [Flag insights](home/flags/insights)
