## Overview

This topic explains how to configure SSO integration between a self-hosted Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) server and LaunchDarkly.

ADFS is a service provided by Microsoft as a standard role for Windows Server. It provides a web login using existing Active Directory credentials.

<CalloutTitle>Troubleshooting ADFS-based SSO</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you need information about ADFS errors during configuration, troubleshoot it by accessing the ADFS logs in the Windows Event Viewer.

</CalloutDescription>

## Prerequisites

To give your team access to LaunchDarkly through ADFS, you need the following components:

- An Enterprise LaunchDarkly account.
- A signed SSL certificate.
- An Active Directory instance where all users have an email address attribute.
- A Microsoft Server instance with ADFS installed and configured.

## Set Up LaunchDarkly

  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>

      <TableCell>
        Copy the Token Signing certificate to a Base-64 encoded x.509 file and import it into LaunchDarkly
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>X.509 certificate</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        Default value: <code>https://YOUR-DOMAIN/adfs/ls/</code>. <br />
        If the default value fails, confirm that the endpoint is enabled and the URL path is correct.
        <br />
        Find the endpoint in Service > Endpoints Search for an endpoint with the <code>
          SAML 2.0/WS-Federation
        </code> type.

In the following example, we use the user's UPN as their name ID. As a best practice, we recommend setting the user's UPN to their email address instead.

6. Set the following options:

- Claim rule name: Enter a human-readable name, such as `Email to NameID`.
- Incoming claim type: **E-Mail Address**
- Outgoing claim type: **Name ID**
- Outgoing name ID format: **Email**

7. Select **Pass through all claim values** and click **Finish**.

After you have successfully completed this procedure, ADFS will be configured with LaunchDarkly.

## Test Drive and Enable

After you successfully complete the procedures in this topic, you can log in through ADFS when test drive is enabled. For more information about test drive, read [Test drive mode](/home/account-security/sso#test-drive-mode).

If you are able to successfully log in with test drive enabled, you can enable SSO fully. For more information about enabling SSO, read [Enabling SSO](/home/account-security/sso#enabling-sso).
