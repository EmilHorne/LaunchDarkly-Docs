## Overview

This topic explains how to enable SCIM user provisioning to work with your SSO-enabled LaunchDarkly account. SCIM facilitates _user provisioning_, which means your IdP can use it to create, update, and deactivate members in LaunchDarkly.

## Prerequisites

In order to complete this procedure, you must have the following prerequisites:

* You must be a LaunchDarkly Owner / Admin
* You must have enabled SSO. To do this, read [Configuring SAML SSO](/home/account-security/sso/saml).

## Configuring SCIM

In your IdP, begin the workflow that links your IdP with SCIM. The workflow will lead to an authorization screen where you can authorize your IdP to manage your account members.

You may only have one SCIM provider linked to your IdP at once. If you need to change providers, disconnect the original provider by following the workflow below and enable a different one through your IdP.

You cannot deactivate an account member using SCIM deprovisioning if you added the member to your LaunchDarkly account before you enabled SCIM provisioning or SSO.

## User provisioning with SCIM

<CalloutDescription>

We also have a SCIM API available to allow for user provisioning of account members from IdPs. The SCIM API is only supported for the OAuth2 authorization type. Not all supported third-party providers support user provisioning through SCIM. To learn more about how LaunchDarkly treats users imported from the IdP, read [Understanding default roles](/home/account-security/sso#understanding-default-roles).

We have pre-built integrations with the following providers:

* [Okta](/home/account-security/okta)
* [OneLogin](/home/account-security/onelogin)

You may also configure your provider manually with the following information. Specific names for these fields may vary by IdP:

- SCIM Base URI: `https://app.launchdarkly.com/trust/scim/v2`
- Authorization method: `oauth2`
- Authorization URI: `https://app.launchdarkly.com/trust/oauth/authorize`
- Access token URI: `https://app.launchdarkly.com/trust/oauth/token`
- Unique Identifier field for account members: `userName`
  If you configure your provider manually, you will also need a client ID and client secret. [Contact Support](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we will generate these for you.

You cannot create new custom attributes through the SCIM API, but you can set two existing custom attributes for SCIM users:

* `role`
* `customRole`

To learn more about these attributes, read [Custom user attributes](/home/users/custom-attributes).

For an in-depth guide on how to use custom roles with IdPs, read [Creating custom roles](/guides/teams-roles/custom-roles).

## Disconnecting SCIM

You can disconnect SCIM at any time.

To disconnect SCIM:

1. Log into LaunchDarkly as an administrator.
2. Navigate **Account settings** > **Security** and scroll to the "SSO management" section.
3. Click **Disconnect SCIM**.
