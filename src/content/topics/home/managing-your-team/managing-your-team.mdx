## Overview

This topic introduces the concept of teams and team members in LaunchDarkly and shows you how to use the Team dashboard.

LaunchDarkly supports user object management with OAuth, SAML, and SCIM. To learn more, read [Enabling single sign-on](/home/account-security/sso).

## Understanding teams in LaunchDarkly

Teams are groups of people who work at your organization or have access rights to your organization's LaunchDarkly environment for another reason, such as contractors or part-time employees.

<CalloutDescription>

LaunchDarkly users are resources, including people, who encounter feature flags in your app. In many cases, they are customers or people accessing your product. To learn more about users, read [The Users dashboard](/home/users/users-dashboard).

Use the **Team** tab to invite new team members to LaunchDarkly, remove old team members, or manage access controls for team members by setting roles.

To access the Team dashboard:

1. Navigate to the the [Account Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings) page.
2. Click into the [Team](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/team) tab.
3. Enter an email address for someone you wish to invite to LaunchDarkly and click **Send Invitation** or click **Edit** next to an existing user to modify their information:

## Understanding member roles

You can assign different roles to LaunchDarkly members. There are three different built-in roles in LaunchDarkly. Every member of your LaunchDarkly team must have one of these roles. To learn more about these roles, read [LaunchDarkly's built-in roles](/home/team/built-in-roles).

In addition to a built-in role, you can give team members custom roles to more tightly define the actions they can and can't take in your LaunchDarkly project. To learn more, read [Custom roles](/home/team/custom-roles).

## Enabling multi-factor authentication

For additional security, you can require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your team. When MFA is enabled, team members won't be able to log in to LaunchDarkly without verifying their identity with a second method.

We strongly recommend that all LaunchDarkly users enable MFA for their account, and that administrators enforce MFA for their entire team. In the event of a credential leak or device theft, MFA can prevent malicious third parties from accessing a LaunchDarkly account they should not be able to access.

To learn more, read [Multi-factor authentication](/home/account-security/mfa).

## Inviting users with trial accounts

When you invite a user to LaunchDarkly, you may get an error message that says the email address is already in use. This can happen when a person already has a trial account with LaunchDarkly associated with that email address.

To fix this, ask the person to change the email adress associated with their trial account or delete their trial account, following the instructions under [Adding members who signed up for a trial](/home/getting-started/your-team#adding-members-who-signed-up-for-a-trial). After they change the email address or delete their trial account, add them to your LaunchDarkly organization again.

You can also tell people in your organization to delete their trials before you roll out LaunchDarkly organization-wide.

## Using aliased email addresses in LaunchDarkly

Alternatively, if the user has a GSuite or Outlook 365 account, you can invite them to LaunchDarkly using an alias. An alias account is the email address of the person you wish to invite with a plus sign (`+`) and additional text string appended. `joe@example.com+launchdarkly` is an alias of `joe@example.com`.

For example, if the user object `alice@diner.com` already exists in LaunchDarkly, you can also invite `alice+newproject@diner.com` to your LaunchDarkly organization. Emails from both addresses are sent to `alice@diner.com`, but only `alice+newproject@diner.com` has access to your LaunchDarkly organization. This is also helpful when you need contractors to collaborate with you on projects.
