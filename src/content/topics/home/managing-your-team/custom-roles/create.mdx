## Overview

This topic explains how to create and implement custom roles and policies in LaunchDarkly.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>This topic only describes creating custom roles with the basic policy editor</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you need to use custom roles to address a scenario not covered in the documentation, you can write your own policies with the advanced editor.

To learn more, read [Writing policies in the advanced editor](/home/team/role-policies#writing-policies-in-the-advanced-editor).

4. Enter a human-readable **Name** for the role.

6. (Optional) Enter a **Description** to explain what the role does.
7. Create a policy in the "Policy" fields.
8. Click **Save Role**:

## Creating policies for custom roles

Policies are sets of actions a custom role is allowed or not allowed to take. You can create policies from the **Roles** tab.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Write policies by hand in the advanced editor</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Advanced users can write custom policies of their own with the Aadvanced editor.

To learn more about writing your own
policies, read [Using policies](/home/team/role-policies).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To create a policy:

1. Complete the steps in [Creating a custom role](#creating-a-custom-role).
2. In the "Create a role" screen, click into the **Resources** field.
3. Specify a resource this policy affects.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>The resource finder can help</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Many common LaunchDarkly items are resources, including flags, metrics, and more. If your LaunchDarkly project is large, it may be difficult to find the exact resource you need.

Click **Resource finder** to choose projects, feature flags, environments, metrics, and roles to add to your policy.

To learn more, read [Finding resource IDs](/home/team/role-policies#finding-resource-ids).

4. Choose an **Effect** from the dropdown.
5. Choose one or more **Actions** for the policy to enforce:

6. Click **Update**. The results of your policy display:

## Giving a team member a custom role

After you have created a custom role and policies for it, you must give that role to all members to whom you wish it to apply.

To give a member a custom role:

1. Navigate to **Account Settings**.
2. Click into the **Team** tab and find the team member you wish to give a custom role.
3. Click **Edit** beside that team member's name. The member's Settings page opens:

![The member's Settings page.](../../../../images/settings-team-member-edit.png)


4. Click the member's **Role**. A dropdown menu expands.
5. Choose **Custom**. All available custom roles appear with checkboxes beside them:

![The Role dropdown menu.](../../../../images/settings-team-role-dropdown.png)

6. Choose all custom roles you wish to give the member.
7. Click **Save Member**:

![Custom roles given to the member.](../../../../images/settings-team-custom-roles-assigned.png)


<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>You must assign roles to members individually</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must add a custom role to one member at a time. You may not apply a role to multiple members simultaneously.

For example, if you wish to add a role for the QA team, you must find each QA team member and add the role to each member individually.

</CalloutDescription>

5. (Optional) If you wish to return the member to a standard role, choose **Reader**, **Writer**, or **Admin / Owner** from the **Role** dropdown:

6. Click **Save Member**.
