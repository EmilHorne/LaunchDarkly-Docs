## Overview

This topic explains the three built-in roles that come with every LaunchDarkly project, and how they relate to each other.

## Understanding LaunchDarkly's built-in roles

LaunchDarkly has three built-in roles: `reader`, `writer`, and `owner / admin`. Every new team member must be given one of these roles.

Every team member must have at least either one of these three built-in roles or a custom role. If you need to, you can also assign team members multiple custom roles to give them the exact set of permissions they need.

A team member's initial role is set when they're invited to LaunchDarkly. If not otherwise specified, new team members are assigned the `reader` role. A team member with the ability to do so must adjust a reader's role to give them more advanced permissions.

The one exception to this is the first team member, the person who created your LaunchDarkly account. This role is granted `owner` permissions automatically, because they are required to configure your account completely and add more team members. You can change the account owner when there is more than one team member in your LaunchDarkly project. To learn more, read [Changing account owners](/home/account-security/account-owners).

The three built-in roles are explained in more detail in this table:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
      <TableHeadCell>Role</TableHeadCell>
      <TableHeadCell>Description</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
      <code>reader</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
      Readers can see information in LaunchDarkly, but can't modify it. This role is perfect for members of your organization that need visibility into your feature flags, but shouldn’t be able to modify rollout rules or administer the system.

    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
      <code>writer</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
      Writers can make changes to LaunchDarkly that impact what the platform does. For example, they can modify feature flags, metrics, environments, projects, and more. They can’t add new team members to the account or manage your payment method or plans. This role is appropriate for team members who need the ability to configure how your organization's feature flags work.

    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
      <code>admin</code> and <code>owner/admin</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
      Admins can do anything in LaunchDarkly except modify which team member has the owner role. There can be multiple admins in a LaunchDarkly project.<br /><br />Owners can do anything Admins can do in LaunchDarkly, as well as reassign the owner role to another team member.

## Understanding how built-in roles interact with custom roles

You can give team members custom permissions by giving them custom roles. If you need more granular control over which users can do what, custom roles are for you. Custom roles let you define specific permissions for users or groups and apply them across your organization.

This is useful if you have users with multiple jobs, such as someone who needs access to flags controlled by an engineering team and the
support team, or product managers who also code.
