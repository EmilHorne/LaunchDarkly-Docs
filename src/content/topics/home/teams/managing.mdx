## Managing team maintainers

If you have an `owner / admin` role or the required custom role permissions, you can add and remove team maintainers from new and existing teams.

### Adding a team maintainer to an existing team

You can add maintainers to a team when you create a team, or you can add maintainers to existing teams. To learn more about creating teams, read [Creating a team](/home/teams/creating).

If you have an existing team and you want to add a maintainer to it:

1. Navigate to [Account settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings).
2. Click into the [Teams](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/teams) tab.
3. Click **Manage**. The "Manage" screen appears.

To remove a member from the team management page:

1. Navigate to the [Account settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings) page.
2. Click into the [Teams](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/teams) tab and find the team that you want to remove the member from.

## Viewing an individual member's teams

Members of your organization can belong to multiple teams.

To view the teams that a member is on:

1. Navigate to [Members](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/members).
2. Filter the list of members for the member you're looking for.
3. Find the "Teams" column. The teams of which that member is a part are listed here. There may be additional teams in the overflow menu.

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Maintained teams do not necessarily appear in the "Teams" column</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

 Team maintainers are not members of the team, so the teams they maintain do not appear in the "Teams" column.

  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

### Viewing an individual member's roles

To view an individual member's roles from the Members page:
1. Navigate to [Members](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/members).
2. Filter the list of members for the member you're looking for.
3. Click **Manage** / **Details** for the member you want to view.
4. In the "Team membership and roles" section you can view:
  * Any teams that they are a member of
  * Any teams that they maintain
  * Any custom roles granted to them through the teams that they are a member of
  * If you have permission to remove members, you will also see a "Remove Member" button. This allows you to remove this member from the team.


A team maintainer who is not also a team member cannot be removed while viewing their individual member "Access" screen. To learn how to remove a team maintainer, read [Removing a team maintainer from a team](#removing-a-team-maintainer-from-a-team).
