## Viewing an individual member's teams

Members of your organization can belong to multiple teams.

To view the teams that a member is on:

2. Filter the list of members for the member you're looking for.
3. Find the "Teams" column. The teams of which that member is a part are listed here. There may be additional teams in the overflow menu.

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Maintained teams do not necessarily appear in the "Teams" column</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

 Team maintainers are not members of the team, so the teams they maintain do not appear in the "Teams" column.
