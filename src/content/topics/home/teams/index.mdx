## Overview

This category contains documentation topics about how to set up and manage teams within your LaunchDarkly organization. A team is a group of members of your LaunchDarkly account.

In these topics, you can learn how to create teams in LaunchDarkly, add and remove members of your organization to teams, and use custom roles to give teams specific permissions and access to different parts of LaunchDarkly.

## Understanding teams in LaunchDarkly

Teams are groups of your organization's members. A LaunchDarkly account administrator can give specific permissions to teams that let them perform actions on different resources, such as projects or flags, in LaunchDarkly.

Large organizations often need to set up fine-grained access rules and give those permissions to specific groups of people. Assigning permissions to groups of people in an organization can help make consistent security or general workflow processes. In LaunchDarkly, teams are the mechanism for enterprise organizations to do that efficiently.

A team is primarily made up of two collections of data:
* A list of the **members** of the larger organization who are on that team.
* A list of the **permissions** that the team's members have.

With teams you can:
* Easily give new members in your organization a set of custom roles by adding them to an existing team.
* Control environment permissions at the group level, rather than individually assigning an environment's access privileges to members.
* Map permissions in LaunchDarkly to your organizational structure. For example, you can give mobile flag permissions to the mobile team and desktop flag permissions to the desktop team, or give all organization members access to the staging environment, but only people on a particular team permissions to control flags on production.

## Understanding how team roles interact with individual member roles

Every organization using LaunchDarkly is made up of members. Members are people who work for your organization or use your organization's LaunchDarkly account. Every member must be individually assigned either one of LaunchDarkly's built-in roles or a custom role. To learn more, read [LaunchDarkly's built-in roles](/home/members/built-in-roles) and [Custom roles](/home/members/custom-roles).

Organizations use custom roles to gain more precise control over their feature flags, experiments, or LaunchDarkly administration. Custom roles are the granular permission scopes that an Admin can set up for their organization. An individual member may have a custom role. To learn more, read [Custom roles](/home/members/custom-roles).

Because a member can only have either a built-in role or custom role(s) and teams receive their permissions from custom roles, if a member has a built-in role, that role is  overridden if a custom role is assigned to that member's team.

This results in the following:
* If a member has a built-in `reader` role individually assigned to them, they can only gain more access to their LaunchDarkly project from a custom role assigned to their team.
* If a member has a built-in `writer` or `owner / admin` role individually assigned to them, they could potentially lose access due to a team-assigned custom role. If this occurs, a warning appears to notify the admin before they save a team configuration that may restrict access. If you want the member to retain their built-in `writer` or `owner / admin` rights, create a custom role with the same permissions as these built-in roles and assign that custom role to the member before you add them to the team. To learn more and find templates you can copy when creating custom roles, read [Example policies and templates](/home/members/example-policies).

A team can have one or more custom roles assigned to it. In cases where a team's custom roles have conflicting permission levels, or a team's custom role has conflicting permission levels with the permissions assigned to a member of that team, the more permissive set of permissions will be applied. For example, if a team has one custom role that allows access to a resource, and a member of that team has another custom role that restricts access to a resource, the team member will be able to access that resource.
