## Overview

This topic explains how to set up and use custom properties in LaunchDarkly.

If you're building an integration for LaunchDarkly, it might be helpful to store data for your integration with a LaunchDarkly feature flag. Custom properties allow you to do this.

Each custom property you add to a feature flag can contain a list of associated values. For example, if you create an integration with an issue tracking service, you may want to associate a flag with a list of issues related to a feature's development.

## Setting a custom property

To add a custom property to a flag:

1. Navigate to the flag's **Settings** tab.
2. Click **+ Add custom property**.
3. Choose a property type from the menu.
  * If you choose an existing property type, enter **Values** associated with the custom property.
  * If you choose "New," enter a **Name** and **Key** for the new custom property. Then enter **Values** associated with the custom property.
5. Click **Save**:
