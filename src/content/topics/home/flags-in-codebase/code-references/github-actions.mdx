## Overview

This topic explains how to use the [`ld-find-code-refs`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/) utility with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automatically populate code references in LaunchDarkly. To learn more about the utility and check for the latest version, read [LaunchDarkly Code References with GitHub code references](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/launchdarkly-code-references).

## Prerequisites

To complete this procedure, you must have the following prerequisites:

- An API access token with Writer permissions, stored as a repository secret titled `LD_ACCESS_TOKEN`. To learn more, read [API access tokens](/home/account-security/api-access-tokens).

## Setting up GitHub code references

To set up GitHub code references:

1. Log into GitHub and navigate to your repo.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Secrets** and click **Add a new secret**.
3. Paste in your access token to the field that appears and click **Save secret**.
4. Return to your GitHub repository to create a new Actions workflow.

- **If you already have an `action.yml` file**: Copy and paste the `launchDarklyCodeReferences` job declaration below into the jobs section in your `action.yml` file.
- **If you don't already have a workflow file:** Create a new file titled `action.yml` in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository. Paste the following code in the **Edit file** section:

<CodeTabs
 defaultValue="yaml"
 values={[
   { label: 'YAML', value: 'yaml', },
 ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="yaml">

```yaml
on: push
name: Find LaunchDarkly flag code references
# cancel in-flight workflow run if another push was triggered
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  launchDarklyCodeReferences:
    name: LaunchDarkly Code References
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 11 # This value must be set if the lookback configuration option is not disabled for find-code-references. Read more: https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs#searching-for-unused-flags-extinctions
      - name: LaunchDarkly Code References
        uses: launchdarkly/find-code-references@v2.5.7
        with:
          accessToken: ${{ secrets.LD_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          projKey: YOUR_PROJECT_KEY
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<CalloutTitle>Best practices for configuring an Actions file</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

We strongly recommend that you update the second `uses` attribute value to reference the most recent tag in the [launchdarkly/find-code-references](https://github.com/launchdarkly/find-code-references) repository. This pins your workflow to a particular version of the `launchdarkly/find-code-references` action.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

5. Commit this file under a new branch and submit as a PR to your code reviewers to be merged into your main branch.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Code references are not blocked by PR approval</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You do not need to have this branch merged into the main branch for code references to appear in the LaunchDarkly user interface (UI). Code references will appear for this newly created branch.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

As shown in the example above, the workflow should run on the `push` event and contain an action provided by the [launchdarkly/find-code-references](https://github.com/launchdarkly/find-code-references) repository.

Include the `LD_ACCESS_TOKEN` as a secret, and include a new environment variable containing your LaunchDarkly project key. This is represented by `YOUR_PROJECT_KEY` in the above example. You can find your project key on the **Projects** tab under **Account Settings**, immediately following the project name. Do not use an environment's SDK key, mobile key, or client-side ID for this purpose.

## Troubleshooting

After you create the workflow, you can confirm that it's working correctly by creating a new pull request with the workflow file and verifying that the newly created action succeeds.

If the action fails, there may be a problem with your configuration. To investigate, review the action's logs to view any error messages.

## Additional configuration options

You can configure `ld-find-code-refs` with additional [inputs](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepswith) to enable more functionality.

In addition to inputs, you can skip searching files and directories using a [`.ldignore`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/blob/main/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#ignoring-files-and-directories) file.

You can also use the [`.launchdarkly/coderefs.yaml`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/blob/main/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#advanced-yaml-configuration) file for advanced configuration options, such as configuring custom delimiters and aliases for your flag keys.

This table explains the configuration variables:

        Sets the number of Git commits to search in history for whether a feature flag was removed from code. May be set
        to 0 to disabled this feature. Setting this option to a high value will increase search time. Defaults to{' '}
