## Overview

This topic gives a high-level explanation of how to use the `ld-find-code-refs` script to perform other functions.

## Custom ld-find-code-refs configuration

If you need a trigger mechanism other than one of the supported mechanisms, you can execute the [`ld-find-code-refs`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/) utility directly from your own trigger. For example, you can execute it from a `cron` job or a webhook.

You can configure [`ld-find-code-refs`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/) to detect and push code references to LaunchDarkly from a Git repository.

You can also use the CLI to test the flag finder before setting up an automated trigger. To learn more, read the [GitHub documentation](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/#execution-via-cli) for `ld-find-code-refs`.
