## Overview

This topic explains how to deploy and start the Relay Proxy.

## Deploying and starting the Relay Proxy

You can deploy the Relay Proxy in one of three ways. In order from most common to least common uses, the methods are:

* starting the Relay Proxy from a Docker image,
* starting the Relay Proxy after downloading a release binary, or
* starting the Relay Proxy after building it from source.

### Starting the Relay Proxy from a Docker image

You can start the Relay Proxy from the `launchdarkly/ld-relay` image, which is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/launchdarkly/ld-relay).

To deploy the Relay Proxy with Docker:

1. Use `docker pull` to pull the latest Relay Proxy Docker image:

  <CodeTabs
    defaultValue="relay"
    values={[
      { label: 'Update your Docker container', value: 'relay', },
    ]
  }>
  <CodeTabItem value="relay">

  ```bash
  docker pull launchdarkly/ld-relay
  ```

  </CodeTabItem>
  </CodeTabs>

2. Use `docker run` to run the Relay Proxy from your Docker container while specifying your configuration details.

The simplest way to specify the configuration is with environment variables, using the `-e` option of `docker run`. An example configuration that uses environment variables appears below.

For examples and a full list of allowable variables, read the documentation in the GitHub repository on [Using with Docker](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay/blob/v6/docs/docker.md) and [Configuration](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay/blob/v6/docs/configuration.md).

In the following example, the Relay Proxy is configured to have two LaunchDarkly environments.

For the first environment, the SDK key is `staging-sdk-key`, and the environment name (for the purposes of logging) is `Staging`. For the second environment, the SDK key is `prod-sdk-key`, and the environment name is `Production`.

In this example, the Relay Proxy is configured to listen on port 5000.

The example configuration follows:

<CodeTabs
   defaultValue="relay"
   values={[
     { label: 'Run with a Docker container', value: 'relay', },
   ]
 }>
 <CodeTabItem value="relay">

 ```bash
docker run --name ld-relay              \
     -e LD_ENV_Staging="staging-sdk-key" \
     -e LD_ENV_Prod="prod-sdk-key"       \
     -p 5000:5000                        \
     -e PORT=5000                        \
     launchdarkly/ld-relay
 ```

 </CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Downloading a Relay Proxy release binary

You can download one of the Relay Proxy's most recent release binaries from our GitHub repository. This repository has all versions of the Relay Proxy releases with details about what each release improves or fixes. We recommend using the most recent release.

To learn more about Relay Proxy release binaries, [visit the GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay/releases).

If you want to download a release binary from the GitHub repository, you should know the following things:
* **tar.gz** files are executables. You can use these to run the Relay Proxy directly.
* **.deb** and **.rpm** files are intended for use with a package manager.

When executing the binary, you'll need to tell the Relay Proxy about your desired configuration. You can do so either with a configuration file or environment variables. Continue reading for more information.

### Building the Relay Proxy from source

To build the Relay Proxy from source:

1. Install Go 1.14 or higher. To install Go, read [Go's documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install).
2. Build and install the Relay Proxy binary.

The command to build and install the binary depends on what Go version you are using:

 <CodeTabs
   defaultValue="go1.16"
   values={[
     { label: 'Go 1.16', value: 'go1.16', },
     { label: 'Go 1.15 or 1.14', value: 'go1.15-1.14', },
   ]
 }>
 <CodeTabItem value="go1.16">

 ```bash
 go install github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay/v6@latest
 ```

 </CodeTabItem>
 <CodeTabItem value="go1.15-1.14">

 ```bash
 GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay/v6@latest
 ```

 </CodeTabItem>
 </CodeTabs>

The command will take a while to finish. To see more information about its progress, change `go install` or `go get` to `go install -v` or `go get -v`.

When the command has finished, the executable binary `ld-relay` will be in `$GOPATH/bin`. You can move it to any other location.

When you execute the binary, you must tell the Relay Proxy about your desired configuration. You can do this either with a configuration file or environment variables.

### Using a configuration file

It's common to use a configuration file when you deploy the Relay Proxy from a release binary or build it from source.

You can also use a configuration file when you run the Relay Proxy from a Docker container, but it is less convenient to do because you *must* place the configuration file at `/ldr/ld-relay.conf`.

To use a configuration file:

1. Create a new file:

  <CodeTabs
    defaultValue="single"
    values={[
      { label: 'Basic example', value: 'single', },
      { label: 'Multiple environments', value: 'multiple', },
    ]
  }>
  <CodeTabItem value="single">

  ```text
  # A single environment which only proxies server-side SDKs
  [environment "<YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-NAME>"]
      sdkKey = "<YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-SDK-KEY>"
  ```

  </CodeTabItem>
  <CodeTabItem value="multiple">

  ```text
  # An environment which proxies SDKs with SDK keys or client-side IDs
  [environment "Spree Webapp Production"]
      sdkKey = "SPREE_WEB_PROD_API_KEY"
      envId = "SPREE_WEB_PROD_ENV_ID"

  # An environment which proxies SDKs with SDK keys or mobile keys
  [environment "Spree Mobile Production"]
      sdkKey = "SPREE_MOBILE_PROD_API_KEY"
      mobileKey = "SPREE_MOBILE_PROD_MOBILE_KEY"
  ```

  </CodeTabItem>
  </CodeTabs>

  To learn more about the supported configuration options, visit the [Relay Proxy GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay/blob/v6/docs/configuration.md).

2. Run the Relay Proxy binary while passing an argument to identify your configuration file's location. The following example assumes that the configuration file is in your current directory and named `ld-relay.conf`, and that the `ld-relay` binary is in `$GOPATH/bin`.

Run the following code:

  <CodeTabs
    defaultValue="relay"
    values={[
      { label: 'Run the binary', value: 'relay', },
    ]
  }>
  <CodeTabItem value="relay">

  ```bash
  $GOPATH/bin/ld-relay --config ./ld-relay.conf
  ```

  </CodeTabItem>
  </CodeTabs>


### Using environment variables

The other way to configure your Relay Proxy is with environment variables. This method is available regardless of how you deploy the Relay Proxy, although it is most commonly used with Docker containers.

To use environment variables:

1. Confirm that all of your Relay Proxy configuration values are specified with the appropriate environment variables.

  For example, to specify the SDK key for an environment named `MyEnvName`:

  <CodeTabs
    defaultValue="relay"
    values={[
      { label: 'Example environment variable', value: 'relay', },
    ]
  }>
  <CodeTabItem value="relay">

  ```bash
  export LD_ENV_MyEnvName=<YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-SDK-KEY>
  ```

  </CodeTabItem>
  </CodeTabs>

  To learn more about supported environment variables, visit the [Relay Proxy GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay/blob/v6/docs/configuration.md#configuration-file-format-and-environment-variables).

2. Run the Relay Proxy binary while passing the `--from-env` argument. The following command assumes that the `ld-relay` binary is in `$GOPATH/bin`.

  <CodeTabs
    defaultValue="relay"
    values={[
      { label: 'Run the binary', value: 'relay', },
    ]
  }>
  <CodeTabItem value="relay">

  ```bash
  $GOPATH/bin/ld-relay --from-env
  ```

  </CodeTabItem>
  </CodeTabs>
