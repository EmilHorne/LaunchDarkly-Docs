## Versioning policy

The Relay Proxy's versioning policy matches that of LaunchDarkly's SDKs.

To learn more, read [Versioning policy](/sdk/concepts/versioning) in the SDK documentation section.

## Supported versions

The Relay Proxy follows LaunchDarkly's end of life (EOL) policy to determine each version's maintenance window. The end of life policy also defines when the Relay Proxy can drop support for older versions of its underlying platform (Go).
