## Overview

This topic explains best practices for monitoring the Relay Proxy as it runs, as well as information about exporting metrics and other data.

## Using the Relay Proxy's status resource

The Relay Proxy exposes a status resource containing details about its health.

To learn more about the status resource, read the information in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay/blob/v6/docs/endpoints.md#status-health-check).

## Monitoring the Relay Proxy's performance

When the Relay Proxy is running, you can monitor performance by tracking the following statistics:

- Overall memory utilization
- CPU utilization
- Number of requests coming into the Relay Proxy

These numbers help you understand how frequently the Relay Proxy is used and how resource-intensive it is. To learn more about synthetic benchmarking, read [Testing Relay Proxy performance](/home/relay-proxy/performance).

### Monitoring the Relay Proxy with a data store

If you have connected the Relay Proxy to a data store, you should also monitor the capacity of the data store and how many hits or misses occur during data lookups. If there are a lot of misses and/or the data store is nearing capacity, it may be overflowing during high-traffic periods and need more capacity.

To learn more about monitoring your datastore, read the documentation from your datastore provider.

## Exporting metrics and traces

You can configure the Relay Proxy to export statistics, requests received, and route traces to Datadog, Stackdriver, and Prometheus by using the OpenCensus protocol.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>You cannot export metrics and traces about the Relay Proxy from LaunchDarkly</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You can only export Relay Proxy-related metrics with the OpenCensus protocol. The core LaunchDarkly app and API do not export data in this way.

To learn more about configuring the Relay Proxy to export metrics and traces, read the instructions in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay#exporting-metrics-and-traces).
