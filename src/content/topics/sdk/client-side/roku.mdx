## Overview

This reference guide documents basic usage of our Roku SDK, and explains in detail how features work. LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. To learn more, read [Roku Client GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/roku-client-sdk). You can also try this SDK out by cloning and running a [sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-roku).

The Roku SDK is written in BrightScript.

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting Started process](/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Roku Application.

We provide releases on [GitHub](https://github.com/launchdarkly/roku-client-sdk/releases). Download the latest release and extract the provided files into your source tree. You may need to rename the paths inside `LaunchDarklyTask.xml` depending on your project structure.

For SceneGraph usage add a `LaunchDarklyTask` node to your scene.

To create a client instance, you need your environment's mobile key, available in the Projects tab of your [account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects). Be sure to use a mobile key. Never embed a server-side SDK key into a mobile application.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="brightscript"
  values={[
    { label: 'BrightScript', value: 'brightscript', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="brightscript">

```brightscript
REM get a reference to to task
launchDarklyNode = m.top.findNode("my-node-name")

REM create configuration
config = LaunchDarklyConfig("MY_MOBILE_KEY", launchDarklyNode)

REM create a user
user = LaunchDarklyUser("user-key")

REM initialize the client
LaunchDarklySGInit(config, user)

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

For each SceneGraph component you want to use the SDK in you need to initialize an interface to talk to the SceneGraph. This interface provides all the expected client functionality such as evaluation.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="brightscript"
  values={[
    { label: 'BrightScript', value: 'brightscript', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="brightscript">

```brightscript
REM create the scenegraph communication wrapper
launchDarkly = LaunchDarklySG(launchDarklyNode)

REM use the client
value = launchDarkly.boolVariation("MY_FLAG_KEY", false)

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Use a single instance</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to create a single client instance. The client instance maintains internal state that allows LaunchDarkly to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to this SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must make feature flags available to mobile SDKs before the flags can be evaluated. If an SDK tries to evaluate a feature flag that is not available, the user will receive the default value for that flag.

To make a flag available to this SDK, check the **SDKs using Mobile key** checkbox during flag creation, or on the flag's **Settings** tab. To make all of a project's flags available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Mobile key** checkbox in your project [Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Creating a client outside of the SceneGraph API is similar. In the legacy API you do not need `LaunchDarklySGInit` or the `LaunchDarklySG` functions.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="brightscript"
  values={[
    { label: 'BrightScript', value: 'brightscript', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="brightscript">

```brightscript
REM get a reference to the task
launchDarklyNode = m.top.findNode("MY_NODE_NAME")

REM create configuration
config = LaunchDarklyConfig("MY_MOBILE_KEY", launchDarklyNode)

REM create a user
user = LaunchDarklyUser("user-key")


REM create message port
messagePort = createObject("roMessagePort")

REM initialize the client
launchDarkly = LaunchDarkly(config, user, messagePort)


REM use the client
value = launchDarkly.boolVariation("MY_FLAG_KEY", false)

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

If not using the SceneGraph you need to poll events to drive the client in your standard event loop:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="brightscript"
  values={[
    { label: 'BrightScript', value: 'brightscript', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="brightscript">

```brightscript
while (true)

    REM do not wait forever or timers will break
    msg = wait(3000, messagePort)


    if launchDarkly.handleMessage(msg) then
        REM this message was for the client
    else
        REM handle non client messages
    end if
end while
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>
