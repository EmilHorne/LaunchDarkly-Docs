## Overview

This topic explains how to use the C/C++ client-side SDK, and gives reference information about the SDK's prerequisites and supported features.

All LaunchDarkly SDKs are open source. Clone this SDK from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/c-client-sdk) or read its [API reference](https://github.com/launchdarkly/c-client-sdk).

You can also use this SDK to clone and run a [sample C application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-c-client) or [sample C++ application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-cpp-client).

## Prerequisites

To use the C/C++ SDK, you must have the following prerequisites:

* Windows or a POSIX environment (Linux, OSX, BSD)
* The networking library `libcurl`
* (POSIX environments) `libpthread`

<CalloutTitle>Use this SDK only in desktop and embedded client applications</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

This SDK is intended for use in *single-user* desktop and embedded applications. If you have a C/C++ application and want to set up LaunchDarkly on the server-side, read the [C/C++ server-side SDK reference](/sdk/server-side/c-c--).

To learn more about LaunchDarkly's different SDK types, read [client-side and server-side SDKs](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side).

## Configuring the SDK

The following sections explain how to install and configure the SDK, and then to verify its connection to LaunchDarkly by fetching flag configuration information for a specific user.

### Installing the SDK

Here's how to install the SDK:

1. Clone [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/c-client-sdk) or download a release archive from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/launchdarkly/c-client-sdk/releases) page.
2. Install the SDK locally.
 * If you use `cmake`, the build system expects that `libcurl` and `libpthread` (if on POSIX) exist on the system. The `cmake` configuration exports the target `ldclientapi`.
 * If you don't use `cmake` and you cannot use LaunchDarkly's artifacts, use `cmake install` to install the SDK in directory you choose. This copies the required headers, and binaries equivalent to LaunchDarkly's release bundles.
3. Build the C++ wrapper, which is not included in the release binaries. Copy the [header](https://github.com/launchdarkly/c-client-sdk/blob/master/cpp/include/launchdarkly/api.hpp) and [source](https://github.com/launchdarkly/c-client-sdk/blob/master/cpp/api.cpp) files and add them to your own build system.
4. Include the LaunchDarkly SDK headers:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'C', value: 'c' },
    { label: 'C++', value: 'cpp' }
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
#include <launchdarkly/api.h>
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="cpp">

```c
#include <launchdarkly/api.hpp>
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

5. Create a single shared instance of `LDClient`.
6. Specify your *mobile key* to authorize your application to connect to LaunchDarkly for the associated project and environment:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'C', value: 'c' },
    { label: 'C++', value: 'cpp' }
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
unsigned int maxwaitmilliseconds = 10 * 1000;
struct LDConfig *config = LDConfigNew("YOUR_MOBILE_KEY");
struct LDUser *user = LDUserNew("YOUR_USER_KEY");
struct LDClient *client = LDClientInit(config, user, maxwaitmilliseconds);
```

</CodeTabItem>

<CodeTabItem value="cpp">

```cpp
unsigned int maxwaitmilliseconds = 10 * 1000;
struct LDConfig *config = LDConfigNew("YOUR_MOBILE_KEY");
struct LDUser *user = LDUserNew("YOUR_USER_KEY");
LDClientCPP *client = LDClientCPP::Init(config, user, maxwaitmilliseconds);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Use a mobile key, not a server-side SDK key.</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Only use a mobile key from your [Environments](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/environments) page. Never embed a server-side SDK key into an embedded or desktop application. To learn more, read [Keys](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side#keys).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

### Fetching flag configuration

Here's how to verify the SDK is configured correctly by fetching flag configuration data from LaunchDarkly:

1. Call `LDClientInit` to initiate a remote call to the LaunchDarkly service. This fetches the feature flag settings for a given user.

 This call blocks up to the time defined by `maxwaitmilliseconds`. If you request a feature flag before initialization completes, you receive the default flag value. If you want to wait for client initialization, register a callback:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'c', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
void initCallback(LDStatus status)
{
    if (status == LDStatusInitialized) {
        printf("Completed LaunchDarkly client initialization");
    }
}

LDSetClientStatusCallback(initCallback);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

2. Use `client` to check which variation a specific user should receive for a certain feature flag:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'C', value: 'c' },
    { label: 'C++', value: 'cpp' }
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
bool show_feature = LDBoolVariation(client, "YOUR_FLAG_KEY", false);
if (show_feature) {
    // application code to show the feature
} else {
    // the code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CodeTabItem>

<CodeTabItem value="cpp">

```cpp
bool show_feature = client->boolVariation("YOUR_FLAG_KEY", false);

if (show_feature) {
    // application code to show the feature
} else {
    // the code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Lastly, shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#cc-client-side).
