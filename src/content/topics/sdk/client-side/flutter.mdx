<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>This SDK is in beta</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The Flutter SDK is currently in beta and undergoing active development. Elements of this SDK may change without notice. Do not use this SDK in production environments.

## Overview

This reference guide documents the methods available in the Flutter SDK, and explains in detail how these methods work. If you want to dig even deeper, our SDKs are open source. To learn more, view the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/launchdarkly/flutter-client-sdk) or the [generated API documentation](https://launchdarkly.github.io/flutter-client-sdk/). Additionally you can clone and run a [sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-flutter) that uses this SDK.

## Supported platforms

The Flutter SDK supports Android API 16+ and iOS 10.0+.

## Getting started

Building on top of our [Getting Started guide](/home/getting-started), the following steps will get you started with using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Flutter mobile application.

To get started, declare a dependency on the LaunchDarkly Flutter SDK:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="yaml"
  values={[
    { label: 'pubspec.yaml', value: 'yaml', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="yaml">

```yaml
  launchdarkly_flutter_client_sdk: ^0.1.0
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Then, import the package in your application code:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="dart"
  values={[
    { label: 'Dart', value: 'dart' },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="dart">

```dart
import 'package:launchdarkly_flutter_client_sdk/launchdarkly_flutter_client_sdk.dart';
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After you install the SDK, initialize the single shared instance of `LDClient`. Specify your _mobile key_ here. This authorizes your application to connect to LaunchDarkly and retrieve flag values for your application and environment.

The following example shows the simplest way to create the client:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="dart"
  values={[
    { label: 'Dart', value: 'dart' },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="dart">

```dart
LDConfig config = LDConfigBuilder('YOUR_MOBILE_KEY').build();
LDUser user = LDUserBuilder('user key')
    .email('fake@example.com')
    .build();

await LDClient.start(config, user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Use a mobile key</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Always use a mobile key from your [Environments](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/environments) page. Never embed a server-side SDK key into a mobile application.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Using `LDClient`, you can check which variation a particular user should receive for a given feature flag:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="dart"
  values={[
    { label: 'Dart', value: 'dart', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="dart">

```dart
bool showFeature = await LDClient.boolVariation(flagKey, false);
if (showFeature) {
    // application code to show the feature
}
else {
    // the code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Optionally, if your application will no longer use the client, it may permanently shut down the client with `close`. This is not generally required, but is provided to clear any resources associated with the SDK and cleanly shut down.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="dart"
  values={[
    { label: 'Dart', value: 'dart', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="dart">

```dart
await LDClient.close();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>
