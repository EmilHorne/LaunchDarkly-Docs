<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>This SDK is in beta</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The Flutter SDK is currently in beta and undergoing active development. Elements of this SDK may change without notice. Do not use this SDK in production environments.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Overview

This reference guide documents the methods available in the Flutter SDK, and explains in detail how these methods work. LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. The source is available in [GitHub](https://github.com/launchdarkly/flutter-client-sdk) or the [generated API documentation](https://launchdarkly.github.io/flutter-client-sdk/). You can also try this SDK out by cloning and running a [sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-flutter) that uses this SDK.

## Supported platforms

The Flutter SDK supports Android API 21+ and iOS 10.0+. Other Flutter platforms are not supported by this SDK.

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting Started process](/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Flutter mobile application.

To get started, declare a dependency on the LaunchDarkly Flutter SDK:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="yaml"
  values={[
    { label: 'pubspec.yaml', value: 'yaml', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="yaml">

```yaml
  launchdarkly_flutter_client_sdk: ^0.3.0
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Then, import the package in your application code:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="dart"
  values={[
    { label: 'Dart', value: 'dart' },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="dart">

```dart
import 'package:launchdarkly_flutter_client_sdk/launchdarkly_flutter_client_sdk.dart';
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After you install the SDK, initialize the single shared instance of `LDClient`. This authorizes your application to connect to LaunchDarkly and retrieve flag values for your application and environment. To create a client instance, you need your environment's mobile key, available in the Projects tab of your [account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects). Be sure to use a mobile key. Never embed a server-side SDK key into a mobile application.

The following example shows how to create the client:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="dart"
  values={[
    { label: 'Dart', value: 'dart' },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="dart">

```dart
LDConfig config = LDConfigBuilder('YOUR_MOBILE_KEY').build();
LDUser user = LDUserBuilder('user key')
    .email('fake@example.com')
    .build();

await LDClient.start(config, user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to this SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must make feature flags available to client-side SDKs before the flags can be evaluated. If you evaluate a feature flag that is not available, you receive the default value for that flag. If you want a project's flags to be made available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Mobile key** checkbox in your project [Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Using `LDClient`, you can check which variation a particular user should receive for a given feature flag:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="dart"
  values={[
    { label: 'Dart', value: 'dart', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="dart">

```dart
bool showFeature = await LDClient.boolVariation(flagKey, false);
if (showFeature) {
    // application code to show the feature
}
else {
    // the code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Lastly, shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#flutter).
