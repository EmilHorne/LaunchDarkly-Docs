## Overview

This reference guide documents all of the methods available in the React Native SDK, and explains how these methods work. LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. The source is available in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-native-client-sdk) and its generated [API reference](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-native-client-sdk/).

You can also use this SDK to clone and run a [sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-react-native).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>SDK version compatibility</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The LaunchDarkly React Native SDK is compatible with Xcode 12 and React Native 0.64.

If you need support for earlier versions of React Native, use older versions of the LaunchDarkly React Native SDK. To learn more, read [Releases](https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-native-client-sdk/releases).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To learn more about the specific configuration options that are available in this SDK, read the [SDK's API docs](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-native-client-sdk/index.html#ldconfig).

## Getting Started

<Callout intent="warning">
<CalloutTitle>Expo usage</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The LaunchDarkly React Native client-side SDK is not compatible with the Expo managed workflow because the SDK uses native modules. Consider using the [bare workflow](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/exploring-bare-workflow/) instead.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

After you complete the [Getting Started process](/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your React Native code.

First, install the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency. Add the LaunchDarkly npm dependency to your project and link it to your React Native project.

To add the LaunchDarkly npm dependency:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'Installing with npm', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```bash
npm install launchdarkly-react-native-client-sdk
cd ios/
pod install
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You must have a `Podfile` in your `ios/` directory. After you write the `Podfile`, run `pod install` in the `ios/` directory. This SDK requires Xcode 12 and compiles against Swift 5.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle><code>use_frameworks!</code> and undefined symbols errors</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

As of v2.1.0, <code>use_frameworks!</code> is not necessary in the Podfile. If you encounter an undefined symbols error when building without <code>use_frameworks!</code> in your <code>Podfile</code> you will need to create a new empty Swift file and accept the prompt to create a matching Objective-C bridging header. If you are building for multiple platforms, add those as targets for the bridging header. If you're still having trouble resolving the undefined symbols error, clean and rebuild and try again.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="podfile"
  values={[
    { label: 'Podfile', value: 'podfile', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="podfile">

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
require_relative '../node_modules/react-native/scripts/react_native_pods'
require_relative '../node_modules/@react-native-community/cli-platform-ios/native_modules'

target 'YOUR_MODULE_NAME' do
  config = use_native_modules!

  use_react_native!(
    :path => config[:reactNativePath],
    :hermes_enabled => false
  )

  post_install do |installer|
    react_native_post_install(installer)
  end
end
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After you have downloaded the SDK, saved it in `package.json`, and completed the other install steps, import the SDK into your project:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
import LDClient from 'launchdarkly-react-native-client-sdk';
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After the SDK is imported, create a single, shared instance of `LDClient`, passing in the client and user configuration objects. To create a client instance, you need your environment's mobile key. This authorizes your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly.Your mobile key is available in the Projects tab of your [Account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects). Mobile keys are not secret and you can expose them in your client-side code without risk. Never embed a server-side SDK key into a client-side application.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LDClient must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make `LDClient` a singleton. The client instance maintains internal state that allows LaunchDarkly to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To create a shared instance of `LDClient`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
let client = new LDClient();
let config = { "mobileKey": "YOUR_MOBILE_KEY" };
let user = { "key": "user_key" };

await client.configure(config, user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to this SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must make feature flags available to mobile SDKs before the SDK can evaluate those flags. If an SDK tries to evaluate a feature flag that is not available, the user will receive the default value for that flag.

To make a flag available to this SDK, check the **SDKs using Mobile key** checkbox during flag creation, or on the flag's Settings tab. To make all of a project's flags available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Mobile key** checkbox in your project [Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects).

## Background fetch

The React Native SDK defaults to the background fetch behavior for the platform it's running on.

## Shutting down

Shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#react-native).
