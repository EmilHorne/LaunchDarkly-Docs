<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>SDK version compatibility</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The latest version of the SDK is compatible with Xcode 12 and React Native 0.64. If you need support for earlier versions of React Native, refer to older versions of the SDK.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

This reference guide documents all of the methods available in the React Native SDK, and explains in detail how these methods work. If you want to dig even deeper, our SDKs are open source. To learn more, read [React Native SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-native-client-sdk). The online [API docs](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-native-client-sdk/) contain the programmatic definitions of every type and method. Additionally you can clone and run a [sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-react-native) using this SDK.

To learn more about the specific configuration options that are available in this SDK, read the [SDK's API docs](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-native-client-sdk/index.html#ldconfig).

## Getting Started

<Callout intent="warning">
<CalloutTitle>Expo usage</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The LaunchDarkly React Native Client SDK does not work with Expo because the SDK uses native modules. Consider using [ExpoKit](https://docs.expo.io/expokit/expokit/).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Building on top of our [Getting Started guide](/home/getting-started), the following steps will get you started with using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your React Native code.

The first step is to install the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency. Add the LaunchDarkly npm dependency to your project and link it to your React Native project.

To add the LaunchDarkly npm dependency:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'Installing with npm', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```bash
npm install --save launchdarkly-react-native-client-sdk
cd ios/
pod install
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You must have a `Podfile` in your `ios/` directory. After you write the `Podfile`, run `pod install` in the `ios/` directory. This SDK requires Xcode 12 and compiles against Swift 5.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle><code>use_frameworks!</code> and undefined symbols errors</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

As of v2.1.0 <code>use_frameworks!</code> is not necessary in the Podfile. If you encounter an undefined symbols error when building without <code>use_frameworks!</code> in your <code>Podfile</code> you will need to create a new empty Swift file and accept the prompt to create a matching Objective-C bridging header. If you are building for multiple platforms, add those as targets for the bridging header. If you're still having trouble resolving the undefined symbols error, clean and rebuild and try again.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
platform :ios, '10.0'
require_relative '../node_modules/@react-native-community/cli-platform-ios/native_modules'

target 'YOUR_MODULE_NAME' do
  # Pods for ReactNativeRestwrapper

  #launchdarkly-react-native-client-sdk dependencies
  pod 'LaunchDarkly', '5.4.1'

  use_native_modules!
end
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Once the SDK is downloaded and saved in `package.json` and the other install steps are complete, you'll need to import it into your project:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
import LDClient from 'launchdarkly-react-native-client-sdk';
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Once the SDK is installed and imported, you'll want to create a single, shared instance of `LDClient`, passing in the client and user configuration objects. To create a client instance, you need your environment's mobile key (available on your [account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects)). Mobile keys are not secret. You can expose them in your client-side code with no risk.

To create a shared insteance of `LDClient`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
let client = new LDClient();
let config = { "mobileKey": "YOUR_MOBILE_KEY" };
let user = { "key": "user_key" };

await client.configure(config, user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Lastly, when your application is about to terminate, shut down `LDClient`. This ensures that the client releases any resources it is using, and that any pending analytics events are delivered to LaunchDarkly. If your application quits without this shutdown step, you may not see your requests and users on the dashboard, because they are derived from analytics events. This is something you only need to do once.

To shut down `LDClient`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
client.close();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Mobile keys</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Be sure to use a mobile key from your [Environments](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/environments) page. Never embed a server-side SDK key into a mobile application.
