## Overview

This reference guide documents all of the methods available in the client-side Node.js SDK, and explains in detail how these methods work. LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. To learn more, read [Client-Side Node.js SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/node-client-sdk). The online [API docs](https://launchdarkly.github.io/node-client-sdk/) contain the programmatic definitions of every type and method. You can also try this SDK out by cloning and running a [sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-node-client).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>For use in desktop or Node-enabled device applications only</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

This SDK is intended for use in *single-user* desktop or Node-enabled device applications. If you have a Node.js application and are looking to set up LaunchDarkly on the server-side, head to our [Node.js SDK reference](/sdk/server-side/node-js). If you are using Electron, there is an [Electron SDK](/sdk/client-side/electron) more specifically designed for that environment.

To learn more, read [client-side and server-side SDKs](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side).

This SDK is closely related to the [browser JavaScript SDK](/sdk/client-side/javascript) and has almost exactly the same API, but does not have any browser-specific functionality, and adds several features specific to Node.

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting Started process](/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Node.js code.

The first step is to install the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency in your application using your application's dependency manager.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: 'Installing with NPM', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'Installing with Yarn', value: 'yarn', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install --save launchdarkly-node-client-sdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="yarn">

```json
yarn add launchdarkly-node-client-sdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Next, import the LaunchDarkly client in your application code:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
const LaunchDarkly = require('launchdarkly-node-client-sdk');
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Once the SDK is installed and imported, Create a single, shared instance of `LdClient`. This authorizes your application to connect to LaunchDarkly and retrieve flag values for your application and environment. To create a client instance, you need your environment's mobile key, available in the Projects tab of your [account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects). Be sure to use a client-side ID. Never embed a server-side SDK key into a client-side application. Client-side IDs are not secret and you can expose them in your client-side code without risk.

Feature flag targeting and rollouts are determined by the active user. You must pass a user context to the SDK during initialization before requesting any feature flags with `variation`. Failure to pass a valid user context to the SDK during initialization will result in an error.

Here's a basic example showing how to initialize the client:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
const user = {
  key: "aa0ceb"
};

const client = LaunchDarkly.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The client will emit a `ready` event when it has been initialized. You can also use the `waitForInitialization()` method, which returns a Promise. Once it has been initialized, you can safely call `variation` to access your feature flags. The `ready` event is only emitted once, when the client first initializes. In a production application, your calls to `client.variation` would normally not be inside of this event handler.

To emit a `ready` event:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
client.on('ready', () => {
  console.log("It's now safe to request feature flags");

  const showFeature = client.variation("YOUR_FEATURE_KEY", false);

  if (showFeature) {
    ...
  } else {
    ...
  }
});
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Streaming updates</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The SDK does not subscribe to streaming real-time updates automatically when it is initialized. Setting the `streaming` option to `true` in the client configuration causes the SDK to open a streaming connection to LaunchDarkly and receive live feature flag updates. You can also specify an event handler with `client.on('change')` to be notified immediately when a flag changes.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to this SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must make feature flags available to client-side SDKs before the flags can be evaluated. If an SDK tries to evaluate a feature flag that is not available, the user will receive the default value for that flag.

To make a flag available to this SDK, check the **SDKs using Client-side ID** checkbox during flag creation, or on the flag's **Settings** tab. To make all of a project's flags available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Client-side ID** checkbox in your project [Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects).

Lastly, shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#nodejs-client-side).
