This reference guide documents all of the methods available in the Ruby SDK, and explains in detail how these methods work. If you want to dig even deeper, our SDKs are open source. To learn more, read [Ruby SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk). The online [Ruby API docs](https://launchdarkly.github.io/ruby-server-sdk/) contain the programmatic definitions of every class and method. Additionally you can clone and run a [sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-ruby) using this SDK.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>RubyGems</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Due to a bug in recent versions of RubyGems, versions 2.4.x (of RubyGems, not of Ruby) are not compatible with the LaunchDarkly Ruby SDK.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Getting started

Building on top of our [Getting Started guide](/home/getting-started), the following steps will get you started with using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Ruby application.

The first step is to install the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency in your application using your application's dependency manager. Refer to the [SDK releases page](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ruby-server-sdk/releases) to identify the latest version if you want to depend on a specific version.

If you are using Bundler, you can add `gem "launchdarkly-server-sdk"` to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`. Otherwise, you can install the gem directly:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="ruby"
  values={[
    { label: 'Shell', value: 'ruby', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="ruby">

```bash
gem install launchdarkly-server-sdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Next you should import the LaunchDarkly client in your application code. This step may not be necessary if you are using a framework that automatically loads all dependencies, as Rails does.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="ruby"
  values={[
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="ruby">

```ruby
require 'ldclient-rb'
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Once the SDK is installed and imported, create a single, shared instance of `LDClient`. You should specify your SDK key here so that your application will be authorized to connect to LaunchDarkly and for your application and environment.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="ruby"
  values={[
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="ruby">

```ruby
ld_client = LaunchDarkly::LDClient.new("YOUR_SDK_KEY")
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LDClient must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make this a singleton. The client instance maintains internal state that allows us to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. **Be sure that you're not instantiating a new client with every request.**

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Using `ld_client`, you can check which variation a particular user should receive for a given feature flag.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="ruby"
  values={[
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="ruby">

```ruby
show_feature = ld_client.variation("your.flag.key", {key: "user@test.com"}, false)
if show_feature
  # application code to show the feature
else
  # the code to run if the feature is off
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Lastly, when your application is about to terminate, shut down `ld_client`. This ensures that the client releases any resources it is using, and that any pending analytics events are delivered to LaunchDarkly. If your application quits without this shutdown step, you may not see your requests and users on the dashboard, because they are derived from analytics events. **This is something you only need to do once**.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="ruby"
  values={[
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="ruby">

```ruby
# shut down the client, since we're about to quit
ld_client.close
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Initializing LDClient in a Rails Application

To use LaunchDarkly in a Rails application, initialize the client in `config/initializers/launchdarkly.rb`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="ruby"
  values={[
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="ruby">

```ruby
Rails.configuration.ld_client = LaunchDarkly::LDClient.new("your_sdk_key")
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To use LaunchDarkly with the Rails application preloader [Spring](https://github.com/rails/spring), we recommend using an `after_fork` callback in the config/spring.rb file:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="ruby"
  values={[
    { label: 'Ruby - Spring initialization', value: 'ruby', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="ruby">

```ruby
Spring.after_fork do
  Rails.configuration.ld_client = LaunchDarkly::LDClient.new('SDK KEY')
end
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Similarly, with [Unicorn](https://bogomips.org/unicorn/), you'll need to specify an `after_fork` hook in your unicorn.rb config file:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="ruby"
  values={[
    { label: 'Ruby - Unicorn initialization', value: 'ruby', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="ruby">

```ruby
after_fork do |server,worker|
  Rails.configuration.ld_client = LaunchDarkly::LDClient.new('SDK KEY')
end
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

If you use the [Puma](https://github.com/puma/puma) web server, we recommend initializing the client in `on_worker_boot`, as well as initializing in the Rails app:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="ruby"
  values={[
    { label: 'Ruby - Puma initialization', value: 'ruby', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="ruby">

```ruby
on_worker_boot do
  Rails.configuration.ld_client = LaunchDarkly::LDClient.new('SDK KEY')
end
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

If you use the [Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/indepth/ruby/spawn_methods/#smart-spawning-hooks) web server, we recommend initializing the client in `config.ru`, or from any code called while loading `config.ru`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="ruby"
  values={[
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="ruby">

```ruby
if defined?(PhusionPassenger)
  PhusionPassenger.on_event(:starting_worker_process) do |forked|
    Rails.configuration.ld_client = LaunchDarkly::LDClient.new('SDK KEY')
  end
end
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Proxy configuration

The Ruby SDK uses the standard Ruby mechanism for specifying an HTTP/HTTPS proxy: set the environment variable `HTTPS_PROXY` or `HTTP_PROXY` to the URL of the proxy server. All LaunchDarkly services use HTTPS, so `HTTPS_PROXY` is the variable to set unless you are configuring the SDK to use a custom service URL that is not secure, such as a Relay Proxy instance within your private network.

Lastly, shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#ruby).
