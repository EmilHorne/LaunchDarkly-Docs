## Overview

This reference guide documents all of the methods available in the Apex SDK, and explains how these methods work. LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. The source is available in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/apex-server-sdk) and the generated [API reference](https://github.com/launchdarkly/apex-server-sdk/blob/master/doc.md). 

You can also use this SDK to clone and run a [sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-apex-server).

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting Started process](/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Salesforce Apex application.

The first step is deploying the SDK to Salesforce:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="bash"
  values={[
    { label: 'Bash', value: 'bash', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="bash">

```bash
git clone https://github.com/launchdarkly/apex-server-sdk.git
cd apex-server-sdk
sfdx force:source:deploy --targetusername='YOUR TARGET ORG' --sourcepath='force-app'
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Initializing the client

Initialize the client as follows:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="defaultConfig"
  values={[
    { label: 'Default Config', value: 'defaultConfig', },
    { label: 'Custom Config', value: 'customConfig', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="defaultConfig">

```java
LDClient client = new LDClient();
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="customConfig">

```java
LDConfig config = new LDConfig.Builder()
    .setAllAttributesPrivate(true)
    .build();

LDClient client = new LDClient(config);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LDClient must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make `LDClient` a singleton. The client instance maintains internal state that allows LaunchDarkly to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Using `client`, you can check which variation a particular user will receive for a given feature flag:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="java"
  values={[
    { label: 'Apex', value: 'java', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="java">

```java
LDUser user = new LDUser.Builder('abc').build();

if (client.boolVariation(user, 'your.flag.key', false)) {
    System.debug('feature is on');
} else {
    System.debug('feature is off');
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After the SDK is deployed to Salesforce, start the bridge to begin evaluating flags. The bridge must be running in order to receive flag updates and publish events to LaunchDarkly.

## Using the LaunchDarkly Salesforce bridge

The Apex server-side SDK is architected differently than our other SDKs. In most of our SDKs, the SDK downloads feature configurations and sends events by itself. The Apex SDK instead uses an external bridging application to connect LaunchDarkly and Salesforce.

Because the SDK uses a bridge to handle state management, there is no initialization delay required to download flags. Additionally, the lack of state inside the SDK means that initializing multiple instances of the SDK is not problematic.

The Apex SDK exposes two HTTP endpoints that the bridge uses: `/store` and `/event`. The bridge pushes flag updates to Salesforce through one endpoint, and pulls events from Salesforce with the other.

The bridge is a Go application configured with environment variables. The bridge needs authorization for both LaunchDarkly and Salesforce.

To build the bridge from source install Go 1.14 or higher. To install Go, read [Go's documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install). 

Build and run the bridge like this:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="bash"
  values={[
    { label: 'Bash', value: 'bash', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="bash">

```bash
cd bridge && go build .

export LD_SDK_KEY='Your LaunchDarkly SDK key'
export SALESFORCE_URL='Your Salesforce Apex REST URL'
export OAUTH_ID='Your Salesforce OAuth Id'
export OAUTH_SECRET='Your Salesforce OAuth secret'
export OAUTH_USERNAME='Your Salesforce username'
export OAUTH_PASSWORD='Your Salesforce password + security token'

./bridge
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The logs indicate if the bridge is running. If it fails, the logs show the errors that occurred. You must deploy the SDK to Salesforce before you run the bridge.
