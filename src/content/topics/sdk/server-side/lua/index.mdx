This reference guide documents basic usage of our Lua server-side SDK, and explains in detail how its functions work. Our SDKs are open source. To learn more, read [Lua SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/lua-server-sdk). The online [API docs](https://launchdarkly.github.io/lua-server-sdk/modules/launchdarkly-server-sdk.html) contain the programmatic definitions of every type and method. In addition to that, you can clone and run a [sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-lua-server) using this SDK. We provide documentation for running the SDK in [NGINX](/sdk/server-side/lua/nginx), and also [HAProxy](/sdk/server-side/lua/haproxy).

## Getting started

Building on top of our [Getting Started](/home/getting-started) guide, follow these steps to get started using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Lua application.

The Lua server-side SDK is implemented using a foreign function interface that calls the C/C++ server-side SDK. You will need the C/C++ server-side SDK dynamic library to be installed somewhere accessible by the linker.

To learn more, read [C/C++ SDK reference (server-side)](/sdk/server-side/c-c--).

To get started, include the library:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="lua"
  values={[
    { label: 'Lua', value: 'lua', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="lua">

```lua
local ld = require("launchdarkly_server_sdk")
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Once the SDK is installed and imported, you'll want to create a single, shared instance of the client. Specify your SDK key here so that your application will be authorized to connect to LaunchDarkly and for your application and environment.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LDClient should be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make this a singleton. The client instance maintains internal state that allows us to
serve feature flags without making any remote requests. **Be sure that you're not instantiating a new client with every request.**

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Calling `clientInit` initiates a remote call to the LaunchDarkly service to fetch feature flags. This call blocks up to the time defined by `maxwaitmilliseconds`. If you request a feature flag before the client has completed initialization, you receive the default flag value.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="lua"
  values={[
    { label: 'Lua', value: 'lua', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="lua">

```lua
local config = {
    key = YOUR_SDK_KEY
}

local client = ld.clientInit(config, 1000)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Using `client`, you can check which variation a particular user should receive for a given feature flag:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="lua"
  values={[
    { label: 'Lua', value: 'lua', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="lua">

```lua
if client:boolVariation(user, YOUR_FEATURE_KEY, false) then
    print "feature is enabled"
else
    print "feature is disabled"
end
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>
