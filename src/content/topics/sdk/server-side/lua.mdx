## Overview

This reference guide documents all of the methods available in the Lua SDK, and explains how these methods work. LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. The source is available in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/lua-server-sdk) and its generated [API reference](https://launchdarkly.github.io/lua-server-sdk/modules/launchdarkly-server-sdk.html).

You can also use this SDK to clone and run a [sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-lua-server). We provide documentation for running the SDK in [NGINX](/sdk/server-side/lua/nginx) and [HAProxy](/sdk/server-side/lua/haproxy).

## Getting started

After you complete the  [Getting Started](/home/getting-started) process, follow these steps to get started using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Lua application.

The Lua server-side SDK is implemented using a foreign function interface that calls the C/C++ server-side SDK. You need to install the C/C++ server-side SDK dynamic library somewhere accessible by the linker.

To learn more, read [C/C++ SDK reference (server-side)](/sdk/server-side/c-c--).

First, include the library:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="lua"
  values={[
    { label: 'Lua', value: 'lua', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="lua">

```lua
local ld = require("launchdarkly_server_sdk")
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After you install and import the SDK, create a single, shared instance of `LDClient`. Specify your SDK key here to authorize your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LDClient should be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make this a singleton. The client instance maintains internal state that allows us to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Calling `clientInit` initiates a remote call to the LaunchDarkly service to fetch feature flags. This call blocks up to the time defined by `maxwaitmilliseconds`. If you request a feature flag before the client completes initialization, you will receive the default flag value.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="lua"
  values={[
    { label: 'Lua', value: 'lua', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="lua">

```lua
local config = {
    key = YOUR_SDK_KEY
}

local client = ld.clientInit(config, 1000)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Using `client`, you can check which variation a particular user will receive for a given feature flag:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="lua"
  values={[
    { label: 'Lua', value: 'lua', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="lua">

```lua
if client:boolVariation(user, YOUR_FEATURE_KEY, false) then
    print "feature is enabled"
else
    print "feature is disabled"
end
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>
