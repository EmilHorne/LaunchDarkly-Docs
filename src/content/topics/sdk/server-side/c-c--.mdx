## Overview

This reference guide documents basic usage of our C server-side SDK, and explains in detail how its functions work. LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. To learn more, read [C/C++ SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/c-server-sdk). The online [API docs](https://launchdarkly.github.io/c-server-sdk) contain the programmatic definitions of every type and method. You can also try this SDK out by cloning and running a [sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-c-server).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>For use in server-side applications only</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

This SDK is intended for use in *multi-user* C/C++ server applications. If you have a C/C++ application and are looking to set up LaunchDarkly in a desktop or embedded application, head to our [C/C++ client-side SDK reference](/sdk/client-side/c-c--).

To learn more, read [client-side and server-side SDKs](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side).

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting Started process](/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your C application.

Unlike other LaunchDarkly SDKs, the C/C++ SDK has no installation steps. To get started, clone [this repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/c-server-sdk) or download a release archive from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/launchdarkly/c-server-sdk/releases) page. You can use `CMakeLists.txt` in this repository as a starting point for integrating this SDK into your application.

Once ready, your first step should be to include the LaunchDarkly SDK headers:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'c', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
#include "launchdarkly/api.h"
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Configure logging, and call the global initialization function. These functions must be called before any other operations are performed. LaunchDarkly provides a predefined convenience logger.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'c', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
LDConfigureGlobalLogger(LD_LOG_INFO, LDBasicLogger);
LDGlobalInit();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Once the SDK is installed and imported, you'll want to create a single, shared instance of `LDClient`. You should specify your SDK key here so that your application will be authorized to connect to LaunchDarkly and for your application and environment.

Calling `LDClientInit` will initiate a remote call to the LaunchDarkly service to fetch feature flags. This call will block up to the time defined by `maxwaitmilliseconds`. If you request a feature flag before the client has completed initialization, you will receive the default flag value.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'c', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
unsigned int maxwaitmilliseconds = 10 * 1000;
struct LDConfig *config = LDConfigNew("YOUR_SDK_KEY");
struct LDUser *user = LDUserNew("YOUR_USER_KEY");
struct LDClient *client = LDClientInit(config, maxwaitmilliseconds);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LDClient must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make LDClient a singleton. The client instance maintains internal state that allows us to
serve feature flags without making any remote requests. **Be sure that you're not instantiating a new client with every request.**

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Using `client`, you can check which variation a particular user should receive for a given feature flag:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'c', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
show_feature = LDBoolVariation(client, user, "your.flag.key", false);
if (show_feature) {
    // application code to show the feature
} else {
    // the code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

If it is possible for your flag evaluation to be executed before `client` initializes, you should wrap your call in `LDClientIsInitialized(client)`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'c', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
if (LDClientIsInitialized(client)) {
    // flag evaluation goes here
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Lastly, when your application is about to terminate, shut down `client`. This ensures that the client releases any resources it is using, and that any pending analytics events are delivered to LaunchDarkly. If your application quits without this shutdown step, you may not see your requests and users on the dashboard, because they are derived from analytics events. **This is something you only need to do once**.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'c', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
LDClientClose(client);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Lastly, shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#cc-server-side).
