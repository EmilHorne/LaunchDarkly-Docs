## Overview

This topic explains the basics of the LaunchDarkly Erlang server-side SDK and how it works.

To learn more, visit our [Erlang SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/erlang-server-sdk/). The online [API docs](https://hexdocs.pm/launchdarkly_server_sdk/) contain the programmatic definitions of every type and method. Additionally, you can clone and run sample applications using this SDK with [Erlang](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-erlang/), [Elixir](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-elixir), and the [Phoenix framework](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-phoenix).

## Getting started

Follow the steps below to get started using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Erlang application.

First, you'll need to download the dependency using [Rebar](https://www.rebar3.org/):

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="erlang"
  values={[
    { label: 'Erlang', value: 'erlang', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="erlang">

```erlang
{deps, [
  {ldclient, "1.0.0", {pkg, launchdarkly_server_sdk}}
]}.
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Then add it to your `app.src` file:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="erlang"
  values={[
    { label: 'Erlang', value: 'erlang', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="erlang">

```erlang
{applications,
  [kernel,
  stdlib,
  ldclient
]},
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

If you use Elixir you can download the dependency using [Mix](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html):

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="elixir"
  values={[
    { label: 'Elixir', value: 'elixir', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="elixir">

```erlang
defp deps do
  [
    {:ldclient, "~> 1.0.0", hex: :launchdarkly_server_sdk}
  ]
end
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After you install the SDK dependency, create an instance of the SDK.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Use a single instance</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

While the Erlang SDK supports starting multiple instances, most use cases only need a single instance. Consider using multiple instances only if you need to simultaneously access more than one environment. Do not start an instance every time you need to make a variation or other SDK call.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="erlang"
  values={[
    { label: 'Erlang', value: 'erlang', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="erlang">

```erlang
% This starts an instance with the default options
ldclient:start_instance("YOUR_SDK_KEY")

% You can also start a named instance
ldclient:start_instance("YOUR_SDK_KEY", my_instance)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Now you can check which flag variation a specific user should receive:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="erlang"
  values={[
    { label: 'Erlang', value: 'erlang', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="erlang">

```erlang
Flag = ldclient:variation(<<"YOUR_FLAG_KEY">>, #{key => <<"123">>}, false)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Lastly, shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#erlang).

## Transport Layer Security (TLS)

The SDK includes configuration options that allow you to set custom TLS options. If you don't set these options, then the SDK will use the Erlang/OTP defaults. The default TLS connection settings in Erlang/OTP do not validate the identity or authenticity of certificates.

If your application has existing TLS options, then you can pass them to the SDK:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="erlang"
  values={[
    { label: 'Erlang', value: 'erlang', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="erlang">

```erlang
  ldclient:start_instance(SdkKey, #{
  http_options => #{
      tls_options => YourOptions
  }}),
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The SDK also provides helper methods to create TLS options. We recommend ensuring that the SDK is using a Certificate Authorities (CA) store that is regularly updated for production environments.

Here is a list of helper methods:

- `ldclient_config:tls_basic_options()`: This helper provides a basic TLS configuration suitable for development. It tries to use a CA store in the default location for many linux distributions (`/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`). If it can't find the store, then it will use the store from the `certifi` package.
- `ldclient_config:tls_basic_linux_options()`: This helper provides a basic TLS configuration for linux. It uses the CA store located at `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`. 
- `ldclient_config:tls_ca_certfile_options(CaStorePath)`: This helper provides a basic TLS configuration with the CA store you specify.
- `ldclient_config:tls_basic_certifi_options()`: This helper provides a basic TLS configuration that uses the `certifi` store. Because this store is from a dependency of the package, it is not maintained or updated by OS releases.
- `ldclient_config:with_tls_revocation(TlsOptions)`: This helper extends a TLS configuration with certificate revocation. Revocation is not included in the basic configuration because the Erlang/OTP does not cache revocation results. Enabling this feature incurs additional requests per request the SDK makes.
