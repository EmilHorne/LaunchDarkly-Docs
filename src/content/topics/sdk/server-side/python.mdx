This reference guide documents all of the methods available in the Python SDK, and explains in detail how these methods work. LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. To learn more, read [Python SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/python-server-sdk). The online [Python API docs](https://launchdarkly-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/) contain the programmatic definitions of every class and method. You can also try this SDK out by cloning and running a [sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-python). For an example of using the Python SDK inside an R application see [hello-r](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-r).

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting Started process](/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Python application.

The first step is to install the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency in your application using your application's dependency manager. Refer to the [SDK releases page](https://github.com/launchdarkly/python-server-sdk/releases) to identify the latest version if you want to depend on a specific version.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Shell', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```bash
pip install launchdarkly-server-sdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Next you should import the LaunchDarkly client in your application code:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
import ldclient
from ldclient.config import Config
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Once the SDK is installed and imported, you'll want to create a single, shared instance of `ldclient`. The `get()` function enforces the singleton pattern; you should only have one instance of the client in your application. You should specify your SDK key here so that your application will be authorized to connect to LaunchDarkly and for your application and environment.

To create a single instance:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
ldclient.set_config(Config("YOUR_SDK_KEY"))
client = ldclient.get()
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Using `client`, you can check which variation a particular user should receive for a given feature flag:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
show_feature = client.variation("your.flag.key", {"key": "user@test.com"}, False)

if show_feature:
  # application code to show the feature
else:
  # the code to run if the feature is off
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Configuring uWSGI

The LaunchDarkly SDK is compatible with uWSGI. However, in uWSGI environments, the SDK requires the `enable-threads` option to be set.

## HTTPS proxy

Python's standard HTTP library provides a built-in HTTPS proxy. If the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable is present then the SDK will proxy all network requests through the URL provided.

How to set the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable on Mac/Linux systems:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Shell', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

How to set the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable on Windows systems:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'CMD', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```bash
set HTTPS_PROXY=https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Or it can be set from within Python:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
os.environ["https_proxy"] = "https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080"
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Lastly, shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#python).
