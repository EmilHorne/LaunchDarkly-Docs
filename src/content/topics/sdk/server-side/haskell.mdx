## Overview

This reference guide documents all of the methods available in the Haskell SDK, and explains how these methods work. LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. The source is available in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/haskell-server-sdk) and its generated [API reference](https://launchdarkly.github.io/haskell-server-sdk/).

You can also use this SDK to clone and run a [sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-haskell-server).

## Getting started

Follow the steps below to get started using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Haskell application.

The root module of the SDK `LaunchDarkly.Server` re-exports the entire project.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="haskell"
  values={[
    { label: 'Haskell', value: 'haskell', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="haskell">

```haskell
import LaunchDarkly.Server
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After you import and install the SDK, create a single shared instance of `Client`. Specify your SDK key to authorize your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="haskell"
  values={[
    { label: 'Haskell', value: 'haskell', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="haskell">

```haskell
client :: IO Client
client = makeClient $ makeConfig "YOUR_SDK_KEY"
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Client must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make `Client` a singleton. The client instance maintains an internal state that allows LaunchDarkly to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

You can use `client` to check which variation a particular user will receive for a given feature flag.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="haskell"
  values={[
    { label: 'Haskell', value: 'haskell', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="haskell">

```haskell
boolVariation client "YOUR_FLAG_KEY" (makeUser "abc") False
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Shutting down

Lastly, shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#haskell).
