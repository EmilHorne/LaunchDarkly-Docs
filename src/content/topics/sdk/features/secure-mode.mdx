## Overview

This topic explains how to use the secure mode feature to safely evaluate feature flags in your web browser.

## Using secure mode

Secure mode ensures that users' feature flag evaluations are kept private in web browser environments, and that one user cannot inspect the variations for another user. On an insecure device, a malicious user could use a user key to identify what flag values a user receives by analyzing the results of multiple flag evaluations. Secure mode prevents you from doing an evaluation for a user key that hasn't been signed on the back end.

Secure mode works by having you configure your JavaScript SDK to include a server-generated HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key. This hash is signed with the SDK key for your environment.

Each of our server-side SDKs includes a method to compute the secure mode hash for a user. You can pass this to your front-end code with the mechanism of your choice, such as bootstrapping or as a template variable.

You can enable secure mode for each environment in your LaunchDarkly account's [Account Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects). Secure mode is an environment-wide setting. Enabling it requires every request coming from a client-side JavaScript SDK to contact the back end to evaluate flag variations. You can enable secure mode for your environment even if you're also using mobile SDKs that don't support it. Enabling secure mode does not cause those SDKs to fail.

<CalloutDescription>

You can enable secure mode at any time when you use LaunchDarkly SDKs. As a best practice, we recommend that you enable secure mode during initial SDK configuration, because late-stage changes to your SDK configuration may have negative interactions with other settings.

## Generating a secure mode hash

You can use the following server-side SDKs to generate a secure mode hash:

* [.NET (server-side)](#net-server-side)
* [Go](#go)
* [Java](#java)
* [Node.js (server-side)](#nodejs-server-side)
* [PHP](#php)
* [Python](#python)
* [Ruby](#ruby)
* [Rust](#rust)

### .NET (server-side)

The [`SecureModeHash`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-server-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Server.LdClient.html#LaunchDarkly_Sdk_Server_LdClient_SecureModeHash_) method computes an HMAC signature of a user signed with the client's SDK key.

Here is the method:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
var hash = client.SecureModeHash(user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Go

The [`SecureModeHash`](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5#LDClient.SecureModeHash) method computes an HMAC signature of a user signed with the client's SDK key.

Here is the method:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="go"
  values={[
    { label: 'Go', value: 'go', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="go">

```go
client.SecureModeHash(user)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Java

The [`secureModeHash`](http://launchdarkly.github.io/java-server-sdk/com/launchdarkly/sdk/server/LDClient.html#secureModeHash-com.launchdarkly.sdk.LDUser-) method computes an HMAC signature of a user signed with the client's SDK key.

Here is the method:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="java"
  values={[
    { label: 'Java', value: 'java', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="java">

```java
client.secureModeHash(user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Node.js (server-side)

The `secureModeHash` method computes an HMAC signature of a user signed with the client's SDK key.

Here is the method:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'Node.js', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
client.secureModeHash(user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### PHP

The `secureModeHash` method computes an HMAC signature of a user signed with the client's SDK key.

Here is the method:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="php"
  values={[
    { label: 'PHP', value: 'php', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="php">

```php
$client->secureModeHash(user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Python

The `SecureModeHash` method computes an HMAC signature of a user signed with the client's SDK key.

Here is the method:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
hash = ldclient.get().secure_mode_hash(user)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Ruby

The `secure_mode_hash` method computes an HMAC signature of a user signed with the client's SDK key.

Here is the method:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="ruby"
  values={[
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="ruby">

```ruby
client.secure_mode_hash(user)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Rust

The `secure_mode_hash` method computes an HMAC signature of a user signed with the client's SDK key.

Here is the method:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="rust"
  values={[
    { label: 'Rust', value: 'rust', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="rust">

```rust
client.secure_mode_hash(&user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Computing the hash manually

Alternatively, you can compute the hash yourself.

To compute the hash yourself, locate the SDK key for your environment on your account settings page. Then, compute an HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key, using your SDK key as a secret.

Here's an example that uses Node.js:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
var crypto = require('crypto');
var hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', 'YOUR_SDK_KEY');
hmac.update('YOUR_USER_KEY');
hash = hmac.digest('hex');
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Configuring secure mode in the JavaScript client-side SDK

You should send the computed secure mode hash for your user as the [`hash` attribute](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-client-sdk/interfaces/_launchdarkly_js_client_sdk_.ldoptions.html#hash) in the `LDOptions` object during client initialization and as the [`hash` parameter](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-client-sdk/interfaces/_launchdarkly_js_client_sdk_.ldclient.html#identify) if subsequently identifying new user contexts:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="init"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript initialization', value: 'init', },
    { label: 'JavaScript identify', value: 'identify', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="init">

```js
var client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options = {
  hash: "SERVER_GENERATED_HASH"
});
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="identify">

```js
client.identify(newUser, hash, function() {
  console.log("New user's flags available");
});
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To use secure mode, user objects must contain a predefined `key` attribute. Secure mode is not compatible with the SDK's ability to [automatically generate user keys for anonymous users](/sdk/features/user-config#anonymous-users-in-the-javascript-sdk) because the SDK needs a correctly calculated `hash` value.
