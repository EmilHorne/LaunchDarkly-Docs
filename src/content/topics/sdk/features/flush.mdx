## Overview

This topic explains how to use the flush feature. The flush feature is available on both server-side and client-side SDKs.

## Using the flush feature

The flush feature tells the client to send all of an SDK's pending analytics events to LaunchDarkly as soon as possible. Flushing is asynchronous, so this method returns before it is complete.

Most customers do not need to use the flush feature because SDKs automatically flush their pending analytics events on a periodic frequency.

Details about each SDK's configuration are available in the SDK-specific sections below.

* [Server-side SDKs](#server-side-sdks)

## Client-side SDKs

This feature is available in the following client-side SDKs:

* [.NET (client-side)](#net-client-side)
* [Android](#android)
* [C/C++ (client-side)](#cc-client-side)
* [Flutter](#flutter)
* [iOS](#ios)
* [JavaScript](#javascript)
* [Node.js (client-side)](#nodejs-client-side)
* [React Native](#react-native)
* [Roku](#roku)

### .NET (client-side)

Internally, the client-side .NET SDK keeps an event buffer for `Track` and `Identify` calls. These are flushed periodically in a background thread. In some situations, such as if you're testing out the SDK in a REPL, you may want to manually call `Flush` to process events immediately.

The flush interval is configurable. If you need to change the interval, you can do so with the `Configuration` class.

To call `flush`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
client.Flush();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Android

The Android SDK keeps an internal event buffer for analytics calls. These are flushed periodically in a background thread. You can configure the flush interval if needed.

In some situations, such as when you test out the SDK in a simulator, you may want to manually call `flush` to request any queued events to be sent immediately. This call is non-blocking, so it returns before the events are sent.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="java"
  values={[
    { label: 'Java', value: 'java', },
    { label: 'Kotlin', value: 'kotlin' }
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="java">

```java
client.flush();
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
client.flush()
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The flush interval is configurable.

### C/C++ (client-side)

The LaunchDarkly SDK keeps an internal event buffer for analytics events. These are flushed periodically in a background thread. In some situations, for example, if you're testing out the SDK in a simulator, you may want to manually call flush to process events immediately.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'c', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
LDClientFlush(client);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The flush interval is configurable. If you need to change the interval, you can do so via the configuration.

### Flutter

Internally, the Flutter SDK keeps an event buffer for `track` calls. These are flushed periodically in a background thread. You can configure the flush interval if needed.

In some situations, such as when you test out the SDK in a simulator, you may want to manually call `flush` to request any queued events to be sent immediately. This call is non-blocking, so it returns before the events are sent.

To call `flush`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="dart"
  values={[
    { label: 'Dart', value: 'dart', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="dart">

```dart
await LDClient.flush();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### iOS

Internally, the iOS SDK keeps an event buffer for `track` calls. These are flushed periodically in a background thread. You can configure the flush interval if needed.

In some situations, such as when you test out the SDK in a simulator, you may want to manually call `flush` to request any queued events to be sent immediately. This call is non-blocking, so it returns before the events are sent.

To call `flush`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift', },
    { label: 'Objective-C', value: 'objc', },

Internally, the JavaScript SDK keeps an event buffer for `track` calls. These are flushed periodically in a background thread. You can configure the flush interval if needed.

In some situations, such as when you test out the SDK in a simulator, you may want to manually call `flush` to request any queued events to be sent immediately. This call is non-blocking, so it returns before the events are sent.

This method is asynchronous. You can pass a callback or wait for the returned `Promise` to determine when all events have been flushed.

To call `flush`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
client.flush();
```

### .NET (server-side)

Internally, the LaunchDarkly SDK keeps an event buffer for events generated by evaluations, or by `Track` or `Identify` calls. These events are flushed periodically in a background thread. In some situations, such as if you're testing out the SDK in a REPL, you may want to manually call [`Flush`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-server-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Server.LdClient.html#LaunchDarkly_Sdk_Server_LdClient_Flush_) to process events immediately.

The flush interval is configurable. If you need to change the interval, you can do so with the `Configuration` class.

To call `flush`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
client.Flush();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### C/C++ (server-side)

The LaunchDarkly SDK keeps an internal event buffer for analytics events. These are flushed periodically in a background thread. In some situations, such as if you're testing out the SDK in a simulator, you may want to manually call flush to process events immediately.

This function will not block, but instead initiate a flush operation in the background. The flush interval is configurable. If you need to change the interval, you can do so with the configuration.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'c', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
LDClientFlush(client);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Go

Internally, the LaunchDarkly SDK keeps an event buffer for the analytics events that are produced by calling the `...Variation` or `...VariationDetail` methods, the `Track...` methods, or `Identify`. These are flushed periodically in a background thread. In some situations, you may want to manually call [`Flush`](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5#LDClient.Flush) to process events immediately.

The flush interval is configurable. If you need to change the interval, you can do so by making a custom client configuration.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="go"
  values={[
    { label: 'Go', value: 'go', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="go">
