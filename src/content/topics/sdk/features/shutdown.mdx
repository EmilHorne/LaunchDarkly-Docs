## Overview

This topic explains how to safely shut down different LaunchDarkly SDKs. This feature is available for both client-side and server-side SDKs.

## Shutting down an SDK

LaunchDarkly SDKs use language-specific methods to shut down their instances safely. In most applications, you do not have to manually shut down an SDK.

Details about each SDK's configuration are available in the SDK-specific sections below.

* [Client-side SDKs](#client-side-sdks)
* [Server-side SDKs](#server-side-sdks)

## Client-side SDKs

This feature is available in the following client-side SDKs:

* [C/C++ (client-side)](#cc-client-side)
* [Xamarin](#xamarin)

### C/C++ (client-side)

To fully uninitialize the C/C++ SDK resources, you must use `close`. The operation blocks until all resources are free. It is not safe to use any API methods after this process is initiated.

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'C', value: 'c' },
    { label: 'C++', value: 'cpp' }
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
LDClientClose(client);
```

</CodeTabItem>

<CodeTabItem value="cpp">

```cpp
client->close();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Xamarin

`Dispose` safely shuts down the client instance and releases all resources associated with the client. In most long-running applications, you do not have to call `dispose`.

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'Xamarin', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
ldClient.Dispose();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Server-side SDKs

This feature is available in the following server-side SDKs:

* [.NET](#net)
* [C/C++ (server-side)](#cc-server-side)
* [Erlang](#erlang)
* [Haskell](#haskell)
* [Java](#java)
* [Node.js (server-side)](#nodejs-server-side)
* [Python](#python)
* [Ruby](#ruby)

### .NET

[`Dispose`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-server-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Server.LdClient.html#LaunchDarkly_Sdk_Server_LdClient_Dispose_) safely shuts down the client instance and releases all resources associated with the client. In most long-running applications, you do not have to call `Dispose`.

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: '.NET', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
ldClient.Dispose();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### C/C++ (server-side)

`LDClientClose` uninitializes the resources the C/C++ SDK uses. The operation blocks until all resources are free. It is not safe to use any API methods after this process is initiated.

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'C', value: 'c', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
LDClientClose(client);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Erlang

`stop_instance()`, `stop_instance(Tag)`, and `stop_all_instance()` all safely shut down client instances and releases the resources associated with them.

In most long-running applications, you will not have to call these functions. You can use them to ensure all events have been flushed synchronously before closing your application.

Do not evaluate flags after any of these functions have been initiated.

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="erlang"
  values={[
    { label: 'Erlang', value: 'erlang', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="erlang">

```
ldclient:stop_all_instances()

% Stops the default instance
ldclient:stop_instance()

% Stops a named instance
ldclient:stop_instance(my_instance)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Haskell

`close` safely shuts down the client instance and releases all resources associated with the client.

In most long-running applications, you do not have to call `close`, but you can use it to ensure all events have been flushed synchronously before closing your application.

You should not evaluate flags after `close` has been initiated.

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="haskell"
  values={[
    { label: 'Haskell', value: 'haskell', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="haskell">

```haskell
close client
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Java

[`Close`](http://launchdarkly.github.io/java-server-sdk/com/launchdarkly/sdk/server/LDClient.html#close--) safely shuts down the client instance and releases all resources associated with the client. In most long-running applications, you do not have to call `close`.

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="java"
  values={[
    { label: 'Java', value: 'java', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="java">

```java
ldClient.close()
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Node.js (server-side)

`Close` safely shuts down the client instance and releases all resources associated with the client. In most long-running applications, you do not have to call `close`.

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'Node.js', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
ldClient.close();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Python

`Close` safely shuts down the client instance and releases all resources associated with the client. In most long-running applications, you do not have to call `close`.

To shut down:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
ldclient.get().close()
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Ruby

`Close` safely shuts down the client instance and releases all resources associated with the client. In most long-running applications, you do not have to call `close`.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="ruby"
  values={[
    { label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="ruby">

```ruby
ld_client.close
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>
